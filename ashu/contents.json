PCs are based on the microprocessor technology that enables manufacturers to put an entire CPU on one chip. Businesses use personal computers for word processing, accounting, desktop publishing, and for running spreadsheet and database management applications. At home, the most popular use for personal computers is playing games and surfing the Internet.</p> <p>Although personal computers are designed as single-user systems, these systems are normally linked together to form a network. In terms of power, now-a-days high-end models of the Macintosh and PC offer the same computing power and graphics capability as low-end workstations by Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Dell.</p> <h2>Workstation</h2> <p>Workstation is a computer used for engineering applications (CAD/CAM), desktop publishing, software development, and other such types of applications which require a moderate amount of computing power and relatively high quality graphics capabilities.</p> <p>Workstations generally come with a large, high-resolution graphics screen, large amount of RAM, inbuilt network support, and a graphical user interface. Most workstations also have mass storage device such as a disk drive, but a special type of workstation, called diskless workstation, comes without a disk drive.</p> <p>Common operating systems for workstations are UNIX and Windows NT. Like PC, workstations are also single-user computers like PC but are typically linked together to form a local-area network, although they can also be used as stand-alone systems.</p> <h2>Minicomputer</h2> <p>It is a midsize multi-processing system capable of supporting up to 250 users simultaneously.</p> <h2>Mainframe</h2> <p>Mainframe is very large in size and is an expensive computer capable of supporting hundreds or even thousands of users simultaneously. Mainframe executes many programs concurrently and supports many simultaneous execution of programs.</p> <h2>Supercomputer</h2> <p>Supercomputers are one of the fastest computers currently available. Supercomputers are very expensive and are employed for specialized applications that require immense amount of mathematical calculations (number crunching).</p> <p>For example, weather forecasting, scientific simulations, (animated) graphics, fluid dynamic calculations, nuclear energy research, electronic design, and analysis of geological data (e.g. in petrochemical prospecting).</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

However, data is lost when the power gets down due to volatile nature. SRAM chips use a matrix of 6-transistors and no capacitors. Transistors do not require power to prevent leakage, so SRAM need not be refreshed on a regular basis.</p> <p>There is extra space in the matrix, hence SRAM uses more chips than DRAM for the same amount of storage space, making the manufacturing costs higher.

This type of memory is non-volatile. The information is stored permanently in such memories during manufacture. A ROM stores such instructions that are required to start a computer. This operation is referred to as&nbsp;<strong>bootstrap</strong>. ROM chips are not only used in the computer but also in other electronic items like washing machine and microwave oven.</p> <p>Let us now discuss the various types of ROMs and their characteristics.</p> <h2>MROM (Masked ROM)</h2> <p>The very first ROMs were hard-wired devices that contained a pre-programmed set of data or instructions. These kind of ROMs are known as masked ROMs, which are inexpensive.</p> <h2>PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory)</h2> <p>PROM is read-only memory that can be modified only once by a user. The user buys a blank PROM and enters the desired contents using a PROM program. Inside the PROM chip, there are small fuses which are burnt open during programming. It can be programmed only once and is not erasable.</p> <h2>EPROM (Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory)</h2> <p>EPROM can be erased by exposing it to ultra-violet light for a duration of up to 40 minutes. Usually, an EPROM eraser achieves this function. During programming, an electrical charge is trapped in an insulated gate region. The charge is retained for more than 10 years because the charge has no leakage path. For erasing this charge, ultra-violet light is passed through a quartz crystal window (lid). This exposure to ultra-violet light dissipates the charge. During normal use, the quartz lid is sealed with a sticker.</p> <h2>EEPROM (Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory)</h2> <p>EEPROM is programmed and erased electrically. It can be erased and reprogrammed about ten thousand times. Both erasing and programming take about 4 to 10 ms (millisecond). In EEPROM, any location can be selectively erased and programmed. EEPROMs can be erased one byte at a time, rather than erasing the entire chip. Hence, the process of reprogramming is flexible but slow.</p> <h2>Advantages of ROM</h2> <p>The advantages of ROM are as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Non-volatile in nature</li> <li>Cannot be accidentally changed</li> <li>Cheaper than RAMs</li> <li>Easy to test</li> <li>More reliable than RAMs</li> <li>Static and do not require refreshing</li> <li>Contents are always known and can be verified</li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

It uses the standard Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Every computer in Internet is identified by a unique IP address. IP Address is a unique set of numbers (such as 110.22.33.114) which identifies a computer&rsquo;s location.</p> <p>A special computer DNS (Domain Name Server) is used to provide a name to the IP Address so that the user can locate a computer by a name. For example, a DNS server will resolve a name&nbsp;https://www.google.com to a particular IP address to uniquely identify the computer on which this website is hosted.</p> <p>Internet is accessible to every user all over the world.</p> <h2>Intranet</h2> <p>Intranet is the system in which multiple PCs are connected to each other.

            "<h2>Basics of Computers</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Being a modern-day kid you must have used, seen, or read about computers. This is because they are an integral part of our everyday existence. Be it school, banks, shops, railway stations, hospital or your own home, computers are present everywhere, making our work easier and faster for us. As they are such integral parts of our lives, we must know what they are and how they function. Let us start with defining the term computer formally.</p> <p>The literal meaning of computer is a device that can calculate. However, modern computers can do a lot more than calculate.&nbsp;<strong>Computer</strong>&nbsp;is an electronic device that receives input, stores or processes the input as per user instructions and provides output in desired format.</p> <h2>Input-Process-Output Model</h2> <p>Computer input is called&nbsp;<strong>data</strong>&nbsp;and the output obtained after processing it, based on user&rsquo;s instructions is called&nbsp;<strong>information</strong>. Raw facts and figures which can be processed using arithmetic and logical operations to obtain information are called&nbsp;<strong>data</strong>.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/workflow.jpg\" alt=\"Workflow\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>The processes that can be applied to data are of two types &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Arithmetic operations</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Examples include calculations like addition, subtraction, differentials, square root, etc.</p> </li> <li><strong>Logical operations</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Examples include comparison operations like greater than, less than, equal to, opposite, etc.</li> </ul> <p>The corresponding figure for an actual computer looks something like this &minus;</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/block_diagram.jpg\" alt=\"Block Diagram\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>The basic parts of a computer are as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Input Unit</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Devices like keyboard and mouse that are used to input data and instructions to the computer are called input unit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Output Unit</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Devices like printer and visual display unit that are used to provide information to the user in desired format are called output unit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Control Unit</strong>&nbsp;&minus; As the name suggests, this unit controls all the functions of the computer. All devices or parts of computer interact through the control unit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This is the brain of the computer where all arithmetic operations and logical operations take place.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Memory</strong>&nbsp;&minus; All input data, instructions and data interim to the processes are stored in the memory. Memory is of two types &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>primary memory</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>secondary memory</strong>. Primary memory resides within the CPU whereas secondary memory is external to it.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Control unit, arithmetic logic unit and memory are together called the&nbsp;<strong>central processing unit</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>CPU</strong>. Computer devices like keyboard, mouse, printer, etc. that we can see and touch are the&nbsp;<strong>hardware</strong>&nbsp;components of a computer. The set of instructions or programs that make the computer function using these hardware parts are called&nbsp;<strong>software</strong>. We cannot see or touch software. Both hardware and software are necessary for working of a computer.</p> <h2>Characteristics of Computer</h2> <p>To understand why computers are such an important part of our lives, let us look at some of its characteristics &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Speed</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Typically, a computer can carry out 3-4 million instructions per second.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Accuracy</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Computers exhibit a very high degree of accuracy. Errors that may occur are usually due to inaccurate data, wrong instructions or bug in chips &ndash; all human errors.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Reliability</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Computers can carry out same type of work repeatedly without throwing up errors due to tiredness or boredom, which are very common among humans.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Versatility</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Computers can carry out a wide range of work from data entry and ticket booking to complex mathematical calculations and continuous astronomical observations. If you can input the necessary data with correct instructions, computer will do the processing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Storage Capacity</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Computers can store a very large amount of data at a fraction of cost of traditional storage of files. Also, data is safe from normal wear and tear associated with paper.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Advantages of Using Computer</h2> <p>Now that we know the characteristics of computers, we can see the advantages that computers offer&minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Computers can do the same task repetitively with same accuracy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Computers do not get tired or bored.</p> </li> <li> <p>Computers can take up routine tasks while releasing human resource for more intelligent functions.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Disadvantages of Using Computer</h2> <p>Despite so many advantages, computers have some disadvantages of their own &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Computers have no intelligence; they follow the instructions blindly without considering the outcome.</p> </li> <li> <p>Regular electric supply is necessary to make computers work, which could prove difficult everywhere especially in developing nations.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Booting</h2> <p>Starting a computer or a computer-embedded device is called&nbsp;<strong>booting</strong>. Booting takes place in two steps &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Switching on power supply</li> <li>Loading operating system into computer&rsquo;s main memory</li> <li>Keeping all applications in a state of readiness in case needed by the user</li> </ul> <p>The first program or set of instructions that run when the computer is switched on is called&nbsp;<strong>BIOS</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Basic Input Output System</strong>. BIOS is a&nbsp;<strong>firmware</strong>, i.e. a piece of software permanently programmed into the hardware.</p> <p>If a system is already running but needs to be restarted, it is called&nbsp;<strong>rebooting</strong>. Rebooting may be required if a software or hardware has been installed or system is unusually slow.</p> <p>There are two types of booting &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Cold Booting</strong>&nbsp;&minus; When the system is started by switching on the power supply it is called cold booting. The next step in cold booting is loading of BIOS.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Warm Booting</strong>&nbsp;&minus; When the system is already running and needs to be restarted or rebooted, it is called warm booting. Warm booting is faster than cold booting because BIOS is not reloaded.</p> </li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h4 { color:#00000FF; } </style>"

            "<h2>Classification</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Historically computers were classified according to processor types because development in processor and processing speeds were the developmental benchmarks. Earliest computers used vacuum tubes for processing, were huge and broke down frequently. However, as vacuum tubes were replaced by transistors and then chips, their size decreased and processing speeds increased manifold.</p> <p>All modern computers and computing devices use microprocessors whose speeds and storage capacities are skyrocketing day by day. The developmental benchmark for computers is now their size. Computers are now classified on the basis of their use or size &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Desktop</li> <li>Laptop</li> <li>Tablet</li> <li>Server</li> <li>Mainframe</li> <li>Supercomputer</li> </ul> <p>Let us look at all these types of computers in detail.</p> <h2>Desktop</h2> <p><strong>Desktop</strong>&nbsp;computers are&nbsp;<strong>personal computers (PCs)</strong>&nbsp;designed for use by an individual at a fixed location. IBM was the first computer to introduce and popularize use of desktops. A desktop unit typically has a CPU (Central Processing Unit), monitor, keyboard and mouse. Introduction of desktops popularized use of computers among common people as it was compact and affordable.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/desktop.jpg\" alt=\"Desktop\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Riding on the wave of desktop&rsquo;s popularity many software and hardware devices were developed specially for the home or office user. The foremost design consideration here was user friendliness.</p> <h2>Laptop</h2> <p>Despite its huge popularity, desktops gave way to a more compact and portable personal computer called laptop in 2000s. Laptops are also called&nbsp;<strong>notebook computers</strong>&nbsp;or simply&nbsp;<strong>notebooks</strong>. Laptops run using batteries and connect to networks using Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) chips. They also have chips for energy efficiency so that they can conserve power whenever possible and have a longer life.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/laptop.jpg\" alt=\"Laptop\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Modern laptops have enough processing power and storage capacity to be used for all office work, website designing, software development and even audio/video editing.</p> <h2>Tablet</h2> <p>After laptops computers were further miniaturized to develop machines that have processing power of a desktop but are small enough to be held in one&rsquo;s palm. Tablets have touch sensitive screen of typically 5 to 10 inches where one finger is used to touch icons and invoke applications.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/tablet.jpg\" alt=\"Tablet\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Keyboard is also displayed virtually whenever required and used with touch strokes. Applications that run on tablets are called&nbsp;<strong>apps</strong>. They use operating systems by Microsoft (Windows 8 and later versions) or Google (Android). Apple computers have developed their own tablet called&nbsp;<strong>iPad</strong>&nbsp;which uses a proprietary OS called&nbsp;<strong>iOS</strong>.</p> <h2>Server</h2> <p>Servers are computers with high processing speeds that provide one or more services to other systems on the&nbsp;<strong>network</strong>. They may or may not have screens attached to them. A group of computers or digital devices connected together to share resources is called a&nbsp;<strong>network</strong>.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/server.jpg\" alt=\"Server\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Servers have high processing powers and can handle multiple requests simultaneously. Most commonly found servers on networks include &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>File or storage server</li> <li>Game server</li> <li>Application server</li> <li>Database server</li> <li>Mail server</li> <li>Print server</li> </ul> <h2>Mainframe</h2> <p><strong>Mainframes</strong>&nbsp;are computers used by organizations like banks, airlines and railways to handle millions and trillions of online transactions per second. Important features of mainframes are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Big in size</li> <li>Hundreds times Faster than servers, typically hundred megabytes per second</li> <li>Very expensive</li> <li>Use proprietary OS provided by the manufacturers</li> <li>In-built hardware, software and firmware security features</li> </ul> <h2>Supercomputer</h2> <p><strong>Supercomputers</strong>&nbsp;are the fastest computers on Earth. They are used for carrying out complex, fast and time intensive calculations for scientific and engineering applications. Supercomputer speed or performance is measured in teraflops, i.e. 1012 floating point operations per second.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/supercomputers.jpg\" alt=\"Supercomputers\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Chinese supercomputer&nbsp;<strong>Sunway TaihuLight</strong>&nbsp;is the world&rsquo;s fastest supercomputer with a rating of 93 petaflops per second, i.e. 93 quadrillion floating point operations per second.</p> <p>Most common uses of supercomputers include &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Molecular mapping and research</li> <li>Weather forecasting</li> <li>Environmental research</li> <li>Oil and gas exploration</li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

            "<h2>Software Concepts</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>As you know, the hardware devices need user instructions to function. A set of instructions that achieve a single outcome are called program or procedure. Many programs functioning together to do a task make a&nbsp;<strong>software</strong>.</p> <p>For example, a word-processing software enables the user to create, edit and save documents. A web browser enables the user to view and share web pages and multimedia files. There are two categories of software &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>System Software</li> <li>Application Software</li> <li>Utility Software</li> </ul> <p>Let us discuss them in detail.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/system_software.jpg\" alt=\"System Software\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>System Software</h2> <p>Software required to run the hardware parts of the computer and other application software are called&nbsp;<strong>system software</strong>. System software acts as&nbsp;<strong>interface</strong>&nbsp;between hardware and user applications. An interface is needed because hardware devices or machines and humans speak in different languages.</p> <p>Machines understand only binary language i.e. 0 (absence of electric signal) and 1 (presence of electric signal) while humans speak in English, French, German, Tamil, Hindi and many other languages. English is the pre-dominant language of interacting with computers. Software is required to convert all human instructions into machine understandable instructions. And this is exactly what system software does.</p> <p>Based on its function, system software is of four types &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Operating System</li> <li>Language Processor</li> <li>Device Drivers</li> </ul> <h3>Operating System</h3> <p>System software that is responsible for functioning of all hardware parts and their interoperability to carry out tasks successfully is called&nbsp;<strong>operating system (OS)</strong>. OS is the first software to be loaded into computer memory when the computer is switched on and this is called&nbsp;<strong>booting</strong>. OS manages a computer&rsquo;s basic functions like storing data in memory, retrieving files from storage devices, scheduling tasks based on priority, etc.</p> <h3>Language Processor</h3> <p>As discussed earlier, an important function of system software is to convert all user instructions into machine understandable language. When we talk of human machine interactions, languages are of three types &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Machine-level language</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This language is nothing but a string of 0s and 1s that the machines can understand. It is completely machine dependent.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assembly-level language</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This language introduces a layer of abstraction by defining&nbsp;<strong>mnemonics</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Mnemonics</strong>&nbsp;are English like words or symbols used to denote a long string of 0s and 1s. For example, the word &ldquo;READ&rdquo; can be defined to mean that computer has to retrieve data from the memory. The complete&nbsp;<strong>instruction</strong>&nbsp;will also tell the memory address. Assembly level language is&nbsp;<strong>machine dependent</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>High level language</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This language uses English like statements and is completely independent of machines. Programs written using high level languages are easy to create, read and understand.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Program written in high level programming languages like Java, C++, etc. is called&nbsp;<strong>source code</strong>. Set of instructions in machine readable form is called&nbsp;<strong>object code</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>machine code</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>System software</strong>&nbsp;that converts source code to object code is called&nbsp;<strong>language processor</strong>. There are three types of language interpreters&minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Assembler</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Converts assembly level program into machine level program.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Interpreter</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Converts high level programs into machine level program line by line.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Compiler</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Converts high level programs into machine level programs at one go rather than line by line.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Device Drivers</h3> <p>System software that controls and monitors functioning of a specific device on computer is called&nbsp;<strong>device driver</strong>. Each device like printer, scanner, microphone, speaker, etc. that needs to be attached externally to the system has a specific driver associated with it. When you attach a new device, you need to install its driver so that the OS knows how it needs to be managed.</p> <h2>Application Software</h2> <p>A software that performs a single task and nothing else is called&nbsp;<strong>application software</strong>. Application software are very specialized in their function and approach to solving a problem. So a spreadsheet software can only do operations with numbers and nothing else. A hospital management software will manage hospital activities and nothing else. Here are some commonly used application software &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Word processing</li> <li>Spreadsheet</li> <li>Presentation</li> <li>Database management</li> <li>Multimedia tools</li> </ul> <h2>Utility Software</h2> <p>Application software that assist system software in doing their work is called&nbsp;<strong>utility software</strong>. Thus utility software is actually a cross between system software and application software. Examples of utility software include &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Antivirus software</li> <li>Disk management tools</li> <li>File management tools</li> <li>Compression tools</li> <li>Backup tools</li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

You connect all the basic devices like CPU, monitor, keyboard and mouse; plug in the power supply and switch it on thinking you have everything in place. But the computer will not start or come to life unless it has an operating system installed in it because OS &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Keeps all hardware parts in a state of readiness to follow user instructions</li> <li>Co-ordinates between different devices</li> <li>Schedules multiple tasks as per priority</li> <li>Allocates resource to each task</li> <li>Enables computer to access network</li> <li>Enables users to access and use application software</li> </ul> <p>Besides initial booting, these are some of the functions of an operating system &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Managing computer resources like hardware, software, shared resources, etc.</li> <li>Allocating resources</li> <li>Prevent error during software use</li> <li>Control improper use of computer</li> </ul> <p>One of the earliest operating systems was&nbsp;<strong>MS-DOS,</strong>&nbsp;developed by Microsoft for IBM PC. It was a&nbsp;<strong>Command Line Interface (CLI)</strong>&nbsp;OS that revolutionized the PC market. DOS was difficult to use because of its interface. The users needed to remember instructions to do their tasks. To make computers more accessible and user-friendly, Microsoft developed&nbsp;<strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</strong>&nbsp;based OS called&nbsp;<strong>Windows</strong>, which transformed the way people used computers.</p> <h2>Assembler</h2> <p>Assembler is a system software that converts assembly level programs to machine level code.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/assembler.jpg\" alt=\"Assembler\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>These are the advantages provided by assembly level programming &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Increases efficiency of the programmer as remembering mnemonics is easier</li> <li>Productivity increases as number of errors decreases and hence debugging time</li> <li>Programmer has access to hardware resources and hence has flexibility in writing programs customized to the specific computer</li> </ul> <h2>Interpreter</h2> <p>The major advantage of assembly level language was its ability to optimize memory usage and hardware utilization. However, with technological advancements computers had more memory and better hardware components. So ease of writing programs became more important than optimizing memory and other hardware resources.</p> <p>In addition, a need was felt to take programming out of a handful of trained scientists and computer programmers, so that computers could be used in more areas. This led to development of high level languages that were easy to understand due to resemblance of commands to English language.</p> <p>The system software used to translate high level language source code into machine level language object code line by line is called an&nbsp;<strong>interpreter</strong>. An interpreter takes each line of code and converts it into machine code and stores it into the object file.</p> <p>The&nbsp;<strong>advantage</strong>&nbsp;of using an interpreter is that they are very easy to write and they do not require a large memory space. However, there is a major disadvantage in using interpreters, i.e., interpreted programs take a long time in executing. To overcome this&nbsp;<strong>disadvantage</strong>, especially for large programs,&nbsp;<strong>compilers</strong>&nbsp;were developed.</p> <h2>Compiler</h2> <p>System software that store the complete program, scan it, translate the complete program into object code and then creates an executable code is called a compiler. On the face of it compilers compare unfavorably with interpreters because they &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>are more complex than interpreters</li> <li>need more memory space</li> <li>take more time in compiling source code</li> </ul> <p>However, compiled programs execute very fast on computers. The following image shows the step-by-step process of how a source code is transformed into an executable code &minus;</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/compiler.jpg\" alt=\"Compiler\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>These are the steps in compiling source code into executable code &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Pre-processing</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In this stage pre-processor instructions, typically used by languages like C and C++ are interpreted, i.e. converted to assembly level language.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lexical analysis</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Here all instructions are converted to&nbsp;<strong>lexical units</strong>&nbsp;like constants, variables, arithmetic symbols, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Parsing</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Here all instructions are checked to see if they conform to&nbsp;<strong>grammar rules</strong>&nbsp;of the language. If there are errors, compiler will ask you to fix them before you can proceed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Compiling</strong>&nbsp;&minus; At this stage the source code is converted into&nbsp;<strong>object code</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Linking</strong>&nbsp;&minus; If there are any links to external files or libraries, addresses of their executable will be added to the program. Also, if the code needs to be rearranged for actual execution, they will be rearranged.

Managing processor basically involves allocating processor time to the tasks that need to be completed. This is called&nbsp;<strong>job scheduling</strong>. Jobs must be scheduled in such a way that &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>There is maximum utilization of CPU</li> <li>Turnaround time, i.e. time required to complete each job, is minimum</li> <li>Waiting time is minimum</li> <li>Each job gets the fastest possible response time</li> <li>Maximum throughput is achieved, where throughput is the average time taken to complete each task</li> </ul> <p>There are two methods of job scheduling done by operating systems &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Preemptive scheduling</li> <li>Non-Preemptive scheduling</li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/processor_management.jpg\" alt=\"Processor Management\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Preemptive Scheduling</h2> <p>In this type of scheduling, next job to be done by the processor can be scheduled before the current job completes. If a job of higher priority comes up, the processor can be forced to release the current job and take up the next job. There are two scheduling techniques that use pre-emptive scheduling &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Round robin scheduling</strong>&nbsp;&minus; A small unit of time called&nbsp;<strong>time slice</strong>&nbsp;is defined and each program gets only one time slice at a time. If it is not completed during that time, it must join the job queue at the end and wait till all programs have got one time slice. The advantage here is that all programs get equal opportunity. The downside is that if a program completes execution before the time slice is over, CPU is idle for the rest of the duration.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Response ratio scheduling</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Response ratio is defined as</p> <div class=\"MathJax_Display\"><span id=\"MathJax-Element-1-Frame\" class=\"MathJax\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; display: inline; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; font-size: 15px; text-indent: 0px; text-align: center; text-transform: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; border: 0px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; position: relative;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-mathml=\"&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;&lt;mfrac&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;E&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;l&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;p&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;s&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mspace width=&quot;mediummathspace&quot; /&gt;&lt;mi&gt;T&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;m&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;E&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;c&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;u&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mspace width=&quot;mediummathspace&quot; /&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;m&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mspace width=&quot;mediummathspace&quot; /&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;c&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;v&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mfrac&gt;&lt;/math&gt;\"><span id=\"MathJax-Span-1\" class=\"math\"><span id=\"MathJax-Span-2\" class=\"mrow\"><span id=\"MathJax-Span-3\" class=\"mfrac\"><span id=\"MathJax-Span-4\" class=\"mrow\"><span id=\"MathJax-Span-5\" class=\"mi\">E</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-6\" class=\"mi\">l</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-7\" class=\"mi\">a</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-8\" class=\"mi\">p</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-9\" class=\"mi\">s</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-10\" class=\"mi\">e</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-11\" class=\"mi\">d</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-12\" class=\"mspace\"></span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-13\" class=\"mi\">T</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-14\" class=\"mi\">i</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-15\" class=\"mi\">m</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-16\" class=\"mi\">e</span></span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-17\" class=\"mrow\"><span id=\"MathJax-Span-18\" class=\"mi\">E</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-19\" class=\"mi\">x</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-20\" class=\"mi\">e</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-21\" class=\"mi\">c</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-22\" class=\"mi\">u</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-23\" class=\"mi\">t</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-24\" class=\"mi\">i</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-25\" class=\"mi\">o</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-26\" class=\"mi\">n</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-27\" class=\"mspace\"></span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-28\" class=\"mi\">t</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-29\" class=\"mi\">i</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-30\" class=\"mi\">m</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-31\" class=\"mi\">e</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-32\" class=\"mspace\"></span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-33\" class=\"mi\">r</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-34\" class=\"mi\">e</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-35\" class=\"mi\">c</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-36\" class=\"mi\">e</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-37\" class=\"mi\">i</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-38\" class=\"mi\">v</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-39\" class=\"mi\">e</span><span id=\"MathJax-Span-40\" class=\"mi\">d</span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"MJX_Assistive_MathML MJX_Assistive_MathML_Block\">ElapsedTimeExecutiontimereceived</span></span></div> <p>A job with shorter response time gets higher priority. So a larger program may have to wait even if it was requested earlier than the shorter program. This improves throughput of the CPU.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Non-preemptive Scheduling</h2> <p>In this type of scheduling, job scheduling decisions are taken only after the current job completes. A job is never interrupted to give precedence to higher priority jobs. Scheduling techniques that use non-preemptive scheduling are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>First come first serve scheduling</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This is the simplest technique where the first program to throw up a request is completed first.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shortest job next scheduling</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Here the job that needs least amount of time for execution is scheduled next.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Deadline scheduling</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The job with the earliest deadline is scheduled for execution next.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Memory Management</h2> <p>Process of regulating computer memory and using optimization techniques to enhance overall system performance is called&nbsp;<strong>memory management</strong>. Memory space is very important in modern computing environment, so memory management is an important role of operating systems.</p> <p>As you know, computers have two types of memory &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>primary</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>secondary</strong>. Primary memory is&nbsp;<strong>fast but expensive</strong>&nbsp;and secondary memory is&nbsp;<strong>cheap but slower</strong>. OS has to strike a balance between the two to ensure that system performance is not hurt due to very less primary memory or system costs do not shoot up due to too much primary memory.</p> <p>Input and output data, user instructions and data interim to program execution need to be stored, accessed and retrieved efficiently for high system performance. Once a program request is accepted, OS allocates it primary and secondary storage areas as per requirement. Once execution is completed, the memory space allocated to it is freed. OS uses many storage management techniques to keep a track of all storage spaces that are allocated or free.</p> <h2>Contiguous Storage Allocation</h2> <p>This is the simplest storage space allocation technique where contiguous memory locations are assigned to each program. OS has to estimate the amount of memory required for the complete process before allocation.</p> <h2>Non-contiguous Storage Allocation</h2> <p>As the name suggests, program and associated data need not be stored in contiguous locations. The program is divided into smaller components and each component is stored in a separate location. A table keeps a record of where each component of the program is stored. When the processor needs to access any component, OS provides access using this allocation table.</p> <p>In a real-life scenario primary memory space might not be sufficient to store the whole program. In that case, OS takes the help of&nbsp;<strong>Virtual Storage</strong>technique, where program is physically stored in secondary memory but appears to be stored in primary memory. This introduces a miniscule time lag in accessing the program components. There are two approaches to virtual storages &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Program paging</strong>&nbsp;&minus; A program is broken down into fixed size&nbsp;<strong>page</strong>and stored in the secondary memory. The pages are given&nbsp;<strong>logical address or virtual address</strong>&nbsp;from 0 to n. A&nbsp;<strong>page table</strong>&nbsp;maps the logical addresses to the physical addresses, which is used to retrieve the pages when required.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Program segmentation</strong>&nbsp;&minus; A program is broken down into logical units called&nbsp;<strong>segments</strong>, assigned logical address from 0 to n and stored in secondary memory. A&nbsp;<strong>segment table</strong>&nbsp;is used to load segments from secondary memory to primary memory.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Operating systems typically use a combination of page and program segmentation to optimize memory usage. A large program segment may be broken into pages or more than one small segments may be stored as a single page.</p> <h2>File Management</h2> <p>Data and information is stored on computers in form of files. Managing file system to enable users to keep their data safely and correctly is an important function of operating systems. Managing file systems by OS is called&nbsp;<strong>file management</strong>. File management is required to provide tools for these file related activities &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Creating new files for storing data</li> <li>Updating</li> <li>Sharing</li> <li>Securing data through passwords and encryption</li> <li>Recovery in case of system failure</li> </ul> <h2>Device Management</h2> <p>The process of implementation, operation and maintenance of a device by operating system is called&nbsp;<strong>device management</strong>. Operating system uses a utility software called&nbsp;<strong>device driver</strong>&nbsp;as interface to the device.</p> <p>When many processes access the devices or request access to the devices, the OS manages the devices in a way that efficiently shares the devices among all processes. Processes access devices through&nbsp;<strong>system call interface</strong>, a programming interface provided by the OS.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

            "<h2>Types of OS</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>As computers and computing technologies have evolved over the years, so have their usage across many fields. To meet growing requirements more and more customized software have flooded the market. As every software needs operating system to function, operating systems have also evolved over the years to meet growing demand on their techniques and capabilities. Here we discuss some common types of OS based on their working techniques and some popularly used OS as well.</p> <h2>GUI OS</h2> <p>GUI is the acronym for Graphical User Interface. An operating system that presents an interface comprising graphics and icons is called a&nbsp;<strong>GUI OS</strong>. GUI OS is very easy to navigate and use as users need not remember commands to be given to accomplish each task. Examples of GUI OS includes Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, etc.</p> <h2>Time Sharing OS</h2> <p>Operating systems that schedule tasks for efficient processor use are called&nbsp;<strong>time sharing OS</strong>. Time sharing, or&nbsp;<strong>multitasking</strong>, is used by operating systems when multiple users located at different terminals need processor time to complete their tasks. Many scheduling techniques like round robin scheduling and shortest job next scheduling are used by time sharing OS.</p> <h2>Real Time OS</h2> <p>An operating system that guarantees to process live events or data and deliver the results within a stipulated span of time is called a&nbsp;<strong>real time OS</strong>. It may be single tasking or multitasking.</p> <h2>Distributed OS</h2> <p>An operating system that manages many computers but presents an interface of single computer to the user is called&nbsp;<strong>distributed OS</strong>. Such type of OS is required when computational requirements cannot be met by a single computer and more systems have to be used. User interaction is restricted to a single system; it&rsquo;s the OS that distributed work to multiple systems and then presents the consolidated output as if one computer has worked on the problem at hand.</p> <h2>Popular Operating Systems</h2> <p>Initially computers had no operating systems. Every program needed full hardware specifications to run correctly as processor, memory and device management had to be done by the programs themselves. However, as sophisticated hardware and more complex application programs developed, operating systems became essential. As personal computers became popular among individuals and small businesses, demand for standard operating system grew. Let us look at some of the currently popular operating systems &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Windows</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Windows is a GUI operating system first developed by Microsoft in 1985. The latest version of Windows is Windows 10. Windows is used by almost 88% of PCs and laptops globally.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Linux</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Linux is an open source operating system mostly used by mainframes an supercomputers. Being open source means that its code is available for free and anyone can develop a new OS based on it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>BOSS</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Bharat Operating System Solutions is an Indian distribution of Linux based on Debian, an OS. It is localized to enable use of local Indian languages. BOSS consists of &minus;</p> </li> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Linux kernel</li> <li>Office application suite&nbsp;<strong>BharteeyaOO</strong></li> <li>Web browser</li> <li>Email service&nbsp;<strong>Thunderbird</strong></li> <li>Chat application&nbsp;<strong>Pidgim</strong></li> <li>File sharing applications</li> <li>Multimedia applications</li> </ul> </ul> <h2>Mobile OS</h2> <p>An operating system for smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices is called&nbsp;<strong>mobile OS</strong>. Some of the most popular OS for mobile devices includes&minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Android</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This Linux-based OS by Google is the most popular mobile OS currently. Almost 85% of mobile devices use it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Windows Phone 7</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is the latest mobile OS developed by Microsoft.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Apple iOS</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This mobile OS is an OS developed by Apple exclusively for its own mobile devices like iPhone, iPad, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Blackberry OS</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This is the OS used by all blackberry mobile devices like smartphones and playbooks.</p> </li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

            "<h2>Utility Software</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Application software that assist OS in carrying out certain specialized tasks are called utility software. Let us look some of the most popular utility software.</p> <h2>Antivirus</h2> <p>A virus can be defined as a malicious program that attaches itself to a host program and makes multiple copies of itself, slowing down, corrupting or destroying the system. A software that assists the OS in providing virus free environment to the users is called&nbsp;<strong>antivirus</strong>. An anti-virus scans the system for any virus and if detected, gets rid of it by deleting or isolating it. It can detect many types of virus like&nbsp;<strong>boot virus, Trojan, worm, spyware</strong>, etc.</p> <p>When any external storage device like USB drive is attached to the system, anti-virus software scans it and gives an alert if a virus is detected. You can set up your system for periodic scans or scan whenever you feel the need. A combination of both the techniques is advisable to keep your system virus free.</p> <h2>File management tools</h2> <p>As you know, file management is an important function of operating systems as all data and instructions are stored in the computer in form of files. Utility software providing regular file management tasks like browse, search, update, preview, etc. are called file management tools.&nbsp;<strong>Windows Explorer</strong>&nbsp;in Windows OS,&nbsp;<strong>Google desktop, Directory Opus, Double Commander</strong>, etc. are examples of such tools.</p> <h2>Compression tools</h2> <p>Storage space is always at a premium in computer systems. So operating systems are always looking at ways to minimize amount of storage space taken by files.&nbsp;<strong>Compression tools&nbsp;</strong>are utilities that assist operating systems in shortening files so that they take less space. After compression files are stored in a different format and cannot be read or edited directly. It needs to be uncompressed before it can be accessed for further use. Some of the popular compression tools are&nbsp;<strong>WinRAR, PeaZip, The Unarchiver</strong>, etc.</p> <h2>Disk Cleanup</h2> <p>Disk cleanup tools assist users in freeing up disk space. The software scans hard disks to find files that are no longer used and frees up space by deleting them.</p> <h2>Disk Defragmenter</h2> <p>Disk defragmenter is a&nbsp;<strong>disk management utility</strong>&nbsp;that increases file access speeds by rearranging&nbsp;<strong>fragmented files</strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<strong>contiguous locations</strong>. Large files are broken down into fragments and may be stores in&nbsp;<strong>non-contiguous</strong>locations if contiguous ones are not available. When such files are accessed by the user, access speed is slow due to fragmentation. Disk defragmenter utility scans the hard disk and tries to assemble file fragments so that they may be stored in contiguous locations.</p> <h2>Backup</h2> <p>Backup utility enables backing up of files, folders, databases or complete disks. Backups are taken so that data may be restored in case of data loss. Backup is a service provided by all operating systems. In stand-alone systems backup may be taken in the same or different drive. In case of networked systems backup may be done on backup servers.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

This means that any numerical quantity can be represented using these 10 digits. Decimal number system is also a&nbsp;<strong>positional value system</strong>. This means that the value of digits will depend on its position. Let us take an example to understand this.</p> <p>Say we have three numbers &ndash; 734, 971 and 207.

It is a computer processor that incorporates all the functions of CPU (Central Processing Unit) on a single IC (Integrated Circuit) or at the most a few ICs. Microprocessors were first introduced in early 1970s. 4004 was the first general purpose microprocessor used by Intel in building personal computers. Arrival of low cost general purpose microprocessors has been instrumental in development of modern society the way it has.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/microprocessor.jpg\" alt=\"Microprocessor\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>We will study the characteristics and components of a microprocessor in detail.</p> <h2>Microprocessors Characteristics</h2> <p>Microprocessors are multipurpose devices that can be designed for generic or specialized functions. The microprocessors of laptops and smartphones are general purpose whereas ones designed for graphical processing or machine vision are specialized ones. There are some characteristics that are common to all microprocessors.</p> <p>These are the most important defining characteristics of a microprocessor &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Clock speed</li> <li>Instruction set</li> <li>Word size</li> </ul> <h3>Clock Speed</h3> <p>Every microprocessor has an&nbsp;<strong>internal clock</strong>&nbsp;that regulates the speed at which it executes instructions and also synchronizes it with other components. The speed at which the microprocessor executes instructions is called&nbsp;<strong>clock speed</strong>. Clock speeds are measured in MHz or GHz where 1 MHz means 1 million cycles per second whereas 1 GHz equals to 1 billion cycles per second. Here cycle refers to single electric signal cycle.</p> <p>Currently microprocessors have clock speed in the range of 3 GHz, which is maximum that current technology can attain. Speeds more than this generate enough heat to damage the chip itself. To overcome this, manufacturers are using multiple processors working in parallel on a chip.</p> <h3>Word Size</h3> <p>Number of bits that can be processed by a processor in a single instruction is called its&nbsp;<strong>word size</strong>. Word size determines the amount of RAM that can be accessed at one go and total number of pins on the microprocessor. Total number of input and output pins in turn determines the architecture of the microprocessor.</p> <p>First commercial microprocessor Intel 4004 was a 4-bit processor. It had 4 input pins and 4 output pins. Number of output pins is always equal to the number of input pins. Currently most microprocessors use 32-bit or 64-bit architecture.</p> <h3>Instruction Set</h3> <p>A command given to a digital machine to perform an operation on a piece of data is called an&nbsp;<strong>instruction</strong>. Basic set of machine level instructions that a microprocessor is designed to execute is called its&nbsp;<strong>instruction set</strong>. These instructions do carry out these types of operations &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Data transfer</li> <li>Arithmetic operations</li> <li>Logical operations</li> <li>Control flow</li> <li>Input/output and machine control</li> </ul> <h2>Microprocessor Components</h2> <p>Compared to the first microprocessors, today&rsquo;s processors are very small but still they have these basic parts right from the first model &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>CPU</li> <li>Bus</li> <li>Memory</li> </ul> <h3>CPU</h3> <p>CPU is fabricated as a very large scale integrated circuit (VLSI) and has these parts &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Instruction register</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It holds the instruction to be executed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Decoder</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It decodes (converts to machine level language) the instruction and sends to the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>ALU</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It has necessary circuits to perform arithmetic, logical, memory, register and program sequencing operations.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Register</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It holds intermediate results obtained during program processing. Registers are used for holding such results rather than RAM because accessing registers is almost 10 times faster than accessing RAM.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Bus</h3> <p>Connection lines used to connect the internal parts of the microprocessor chip is called bus. There are three types of buses in a microprocessor &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Data Bus</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Lines that carry data to and from memory are called data bus. It is a bidirectional bus with width equal to word length of the microprocessor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Address Bus</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is a unidirectional responsible for carrying address of a memory location or I/O port from CPU to memory or I/O port.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Control Bus</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Lines that carry control signals like&nbsp;<strong>clock signals, interrupt signal</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>ready signal</strong>&nbsp;are called control bus. They are bidirectional. Signal that denotes that a device is ready for processing is called&nbsp;<strong>ready signal</strong>. Signal that indicates to a device to interrupt its process is called an&nbsp;<strong>interrupt signal</strong>.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Memory</h3> <p>Microprocessor has two types of memory</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>RAM</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Random Access Memory is volatile memory that gets erased when power is switched off. All data and instructions are stored in RAM.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>ROM</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Read Only Memory is non-volatile memory whose data remains intact even after power is switched off. Microprocessor can read from it any time it wants but cannot write to it.

In the past 5 decades microprocessor speed has doubled every two years, as predicted by Gordon Moore, Intel co-founder. Current microprocessors can access 64 GB memory.

Initially, microprocessors had very small instructions sets because complex hardware was expensive as well as difficult to build.</p> <p>As technology developed to overcome these issues, more and more complex instructions were added to increase functionality of the microprocessor. However, soon it was realized that having large instruction sets was counterproductive as many instructions that were rarely used sat idle on precious memory space. So the old school of thought that supported smaller instruction sets gained popularity.</p> <p>Let us learn more about the two types of microprocessors based on their instruction set.</p> <h2>RISC</h2> <p>RISC stands for&nbsp;<strong>Reduced Instruction Set Computers</strong>.

The designing philosophy for RISC incorporates these salient points &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Number of instructions should be minimum.</li> <li>Instructions should be of same length.</li> <li>Simple addressing modes should be used</li> <li>Reduce memory references to retrieve operands by adding registers</li> </ul> <p>Some of the techniques used by RISC architecture include &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Pipelining</strong>&minus; A sequence of instructions is fetched even if it means overlapping of instructions in fetching and execution.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Single cycle execution</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Most of RISC instructions take one CPU cycle to execute.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Examples of RISC processors are Intel P6, Pentium4, AMD K6 and K7, etc.</p> <h2>CISC</h2> <p>CISC stands for&nbsp;<strong>Complex Instruction Set Computers</strong>. It supports hundreds of instructions. Computers supporting CISC can accomplish wide variety of tasks, making them ideal for personal computers. These are some characteristics of CISC architecture &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Larger set of instructions</li> <li>Instructions are of variable length</li> <li>Complex addressing modes</li> <li>Instructions take more than one clock cycle</li> <li>Work well with simpler compilers</li> </ul> <p>Examples of CISC processors are Intel 386 &amp; 486, Pentium, Pentium II and III, Motorola 68000, etc.</p> <h2>EPIC</h2> <p>EPIC stands for&nbsp;<strong>Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing</strong>.

            "<h2>Primary Memory</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Memory is required in computers to store data and instructions. Memory is physically organized as a large number of cells that are capable of storing one bit each. Logically they are organized as groups of bits called&nbsp;<strong>words</strong>&nbsp;that are assigned an address. Data and instructions are accessed through these&nbsp;<strong>memory address</strong>. The speed with which these memory addresses can be accessed determines the cost of the memory. Faster the memory speed, higher the price.</p> <p>Computer memory can be said to be organized in a hierarchical way where memory with the fastest access speeds and highest costs lies at the top whereas those with lowest speeds and hence lowest costs lie at the bottom. Based on this criteria memory is of two types &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>primary</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>secondary</strong>. Here we will look at primary memory in detail.</p> <p>The main features of primary memory, which distinguish it from secondary memory are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>It is accessed directly by the processor</li> <li>It is the fastest memory available</li> <li>Each word is stored as well as</li> <li>It is volatile, i.e. its contents are lost once power is switched off</li> </ul> <p>As primary memory is expensive, technologies are developed to optimize its use. These are broad types of primary memory available.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/primary_memory.jpg\" alt=\"Primary Memory\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>RAM</h2> <p>RAM stands for&nbsp;<strong>Random Access Memory</strong>. The processor accesses all memory addresses directly, irrespective of word length, making storage and retrieval fast. RAM is the fastest memory available and hence most expensive. These two factors imply that RAM is available in very small quantities of up to 1GB. RAM is volatile but my be of any of these two types</p> <h3>DRAM (Dynamic RAM)</h3> <p>Each memory cell in a DRAM is made of one transistor and one capacitor, which store one bit of data. However, this cell starts losing its charge and hence data stored in less than thousandth of a second. So it needs to be refreshed thousand times a second, which takes up processor time. However, due to small size of each cell, one DRAM can have large number of cells. Primary memory of most of the personal computers is made of DRAM.</p> <h3>SRAM (SRAM)</h3> <p>Each cell in SRAM is made of a flip flop that stores one bit. It retains its bit till the power supply is on and doesn&rsquo;t need to be refreshed like DRAM. It also has shorter read-write cycles as compared to DRAM. SRAM is used in specialized applications.</p> <h2>ROM</h2> <p>ROM stands for&nbsp;<strong>Read Only Memory</strong>. As the name suggests, ROM can only be read by the processor. New data cannot be written into ROM. Data to be stored into ROM is written during the manufacturing phase itself. They contain data that does not need to be altered, like booting sequence of a computer or algorithmic tables for mathematical applications. ROM is slower and hence cheaper than RAM. It retains its data even when power is switched off, i.e. it is non-volatile. ROM cannot be altered the way RAM can be but technologies are available to program these types of ROMs &minus;</p> <h3>PROM (Programmable ROM)</h3> <p>PROM can be programmed using a special hardware device called PROM programmer or PROM burner.</p> <h3>EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM)</h3> <p>EPROM can be erased and then programmed using special electrical signals or UV rays. EPROMs that can be erased using UV rays are called UVEPROM and those that can be erased using electrical signals are called EEPROM. However, handling electric signals is easier and safer than UV rays.</p> <h2>Cache Memory</h2> <p>Small piece of high speed volatile memory available to the processor for fast processing is called&nbsp;<strong>cache memory</strong>. Cache may be a reserved portion of main memory, another chip on CPU or an independent high speed storage device. Cache memory is made of fast speed SRAMs. The process of keeping some data and instructions in cache memory for faster access is called&nbsp;<strong>caching</strong>. Caching is done when a set of data or instructions is accesses again and again.</p> <p>Whenever the processor needs any piece of data or instructions, it checks the cache first. If it is unavailable there, then the main memory and finally secondary memory is accessed. As cache has very high speed, time spent in accessing it every time is negligible as compared to time saved if data indeed is in the cache. Finding data or instruction in cache is called&nbsp;<strong>cache hit</strong>.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

Data is stored by magnetizing or demagnetizing the magnetic coating. A magnetic reader arm is used to read data from and write data to the disks. A typical modern HDD has capacity in terabytes (TB).</p> <h2>CD Drive</h2> <p>CD stands for&nbsp;<strong>Compact Disk</strong>. CDs are circular disks that use optical rays, usually lasers, to read and write data. They are very cheap as you can get 700 MB of storage space for less than a dollar.

So they need only one wire to transmit 8 bits. However it also makes them slower. Serial ports are usually 9-pin or 25-pin male connectors. They are also known as COM (communication) ports or RS323C ports.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/serial_ports.jpg\" alt=\"Serial Ports\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Parallel Port</h2> <p>Parallel ports can send or receive 8 bits or 1 byte at a time. Parallel ports come in form of 25-pin female pins and are used to connect printer, scanner, external hard disk drive, etc.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/parallel_ports.jpg\" alt=\"Parallel Ports\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>USB Port</h2> <p>USB stands for Universal Serial Bus. It is the industry standard for short distance digital data connection. USB port is a standardized port to connect a variety of devices like printer, camera, keyboard, speaker, etc.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/usb_ports.jpg\" alt=\"USB Port\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>PS-2 Port</h2> <p>PS/2 stands for&nbsp;<strong>Personal System/2</strong>. It is a female 6-pin port standard that connects to the male mini-DIN cable. PS/2 was introduced by IBM to connect mouse and keyboard to personal computers. This port is now mostly obsolete, though some systems compatible with IBM may have this port.</p> <h2>Infrared Port</h2> <p><strong>Infrared port</strong>&nbsp;is a port that enables wireless exchange of data within a radius of 10m. Two devices that have infrared ports are placed facing each other so that beams of infrared lights can be used to share data.</p> <h2>Bluetooth Port</h2> <p><strong>Bluetooth</strong>&nbsp;is a telecommunication specification that facilitates wireless connection between phones, computers and other digital devices over short range wireless connection. Bluetooth port enables synchronization between Bluetooth-enabled devices. There are two types of Bluetooth ports &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Incoming</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is used to receive connection from Bluetooth devices.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Outgoing</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is used to request connection to other Bluetooth devices.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>FireWire Port</h2> <p>FireWire is Apple Computer&rsquo;s interface standard for enabling high speed communication using serial bus.

Algorithm is normally done in the form of flowcharts and pseudo codes.</p> <h3>Verification of Algorithm</h3> <p>Once the algorithm is developed, it cannot be applied directly rather primarily it needs to be tested specially for the accuracy. If there is any error, it is rectified and solved in the beginning itself. The verification process saves time, money, and energy.</p> <h3>Coding</h3> <p>Once the basic processes and steps are completed successfully, then the actual coding of a program starts in the given programming language.</p> <h3>Testing of Program</h3> <p>Testing of the development of program code is another essential feature, as it is bound with errors; hence, testing makes it error free. The developer keeps testing and correcting the coding until he/she develops it finally.</p> <h3>Documentation</h3> <p>Once the coding and programming is done successfully, it is the job of the developer to document all these features and steps. The documented program instructs users on how to run and operate the respective program.</p> <h3>Implementation</h3> <p>Once the above steps are executed successfully, the developed codes (programming language) are installed in the computer system for the end users. The users are also manuals - explaining how to run the respective programs.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

Unlike a computer virus, it is self-contained and hence does not need to be part of another program to propagate itself.</p> <h3>Trojan Horse</h3> <p>A Trojan Horse is also a sort of destructive program that remains disguised in a normal software program. It is not exactly a virus, as it cannot replicate itself. However, there is possibility that virus program may remain concealed in the Trojan Horse.</p> <h3>Bombs</h3> <p>It is similar to Trojan Horse, but Logic bombs have some specialty; these include a timing device and hence it will go off only at a particular date and time.</p> <h2>How Does Virus Affect?</h2> <p>Let us discuss in what ways a virus can affect your computer system.

For many years, the application of digital electronics was only in the computer system. But now-a-days, digital electronics is used in many other applications. Following are some of the examples in which&nbsp;<strong>Digital electronics</strong>&nbsp;is heavily used.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Industrial process control</li> <li>Military system</li> <li>Television</li> <li>Communication system</li> <li>Medical equipment</li> <li>Radar</li> <li>Navigation</li> </ul> <h2>Signal</h2> <p><strong>Signal</strong>&nbsp;can be defined as a physical quantity, which contains some information. It is a function of one or more than one independent variables. Signals are of two types.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Analog Signal</li> <li>Digital Signal</li> </ul> <h2>Analog Signal</h2> <p>An&nbsp;<strong>analog signal</strong>&nbsp;is defined as the signal having continuous values. Analog signal can have infinite number of different values. In real world scenario, most of the things observed in nature are analog.

Digital signals are not continuous signals. In the digital electronic calculator, the input is given with the help of switches. This input is converted into electrical signal which have two discrete values or levels. One of these may be called low level and another is called high level. The signal will always be one of the two levels. This type of signal is called digital signal.

            "<h2>Binary Codes</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>In the coding, when numbers, letters or words are represented by a specific group of symbols, it is said that the number, letter or word is being encoded. The group of symbols is called as a code. The digital data is represented, stored and transmitted as group of binary bits. This group is also called as&nbsp;<strong>binary code</strong>. The binary code is represented by the number as well as alphanumeric letter.</p> <h2>Advantages of Binary Code</h2> <p>Following is the list of advantages that binary code offers.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Binary codes are suitable for the computer applications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Binary codes are suitable for the digital communications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Binary codes make the analysis and designing of digital circuits if we use the binary codes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Since only 0 &amp; 1 are being used, implementation becomes easy.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Classification of binary codes</h2> <p>The codes are broadly categorized into following four categories.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Weighted Codes</li> <li>Non-Weighted Codes</li> <li>Binary Coded Decimal Code</li> <li>Alphanumeric Codes</li> <li>Error Detecting Codes</li> <li>Error Correcting Codes</li> </ul> <h2>Weighted Codes</h2> <p>Weighted binary codes are those binary codes which obey the positional weight principle. Each position of the number represents a specific weight. Several systems of the codes are used to express the decimal digits 0 through 9. In these codes each decimal digit is represented by a group of four bits.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/weighted_code.jpg\" alt=\"Weighted Code\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Non-Weighted Codes</h2> <p>In this type of binary codes, the positional weights are not assigned. The examples of non-weighted codes are Excess-3 code and Gray code.</p> <h3>Excess-3 code</h3> <p>The Excess-3 code is also called as XS-3 code. It is non-weighted code used to express decimal numbers. The Excess-3 code words are derived from the 8421 BCD code words adding (0011)2 or (3)10 to each code word in 8421. The excess-3 codes are obtained as follows &minus;</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/excess3_code.jpg\" alt=\"Excess-3 code\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h3>Example</h3> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/bcd_excess3_code.jpg\" alt=\"BCD to Excess-3 code\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h3>Gray Code</h3> <p>It is the non-weighted code and it is not arithmetic codes. That means there are no specific weights assigned to the bit position. It has a very special feature that, only one bit will change each time the decimal number is incremented as shown in fig. As only one bit changes at a time, the gray code is called as a unit distance code. The gray code is a cyclic code. Gray code cannot be used for arithmetic operation.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/gray_code.jpg\" alt=\"Gray code\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h3>Application of Gray code</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Gray code is popularly used in the shaft position encoders.</p> </li> <li> <p>A shaft position encoder produces a code word which represents the angular position of the shaft.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) code</h2> <p>In this code each decimal digit is represented by a 4-bit binary number. BCD is a way to express each of the decimal digits with a binary code. In the BCD, with four bits we can represent sixteen numbers (0000 to 1111). But in BCD code only first ten of these are used (0000 to 1001). The remaining six code combinations i.e. 1010 to 1111 are invalid in BCD.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/bcd_code.jpg\" alt=\"BCD code\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h3>Advantages of BCD Codes</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>It is very similar to decimal system.</li> <li>We need to remember binary equivalent of decimal numbers 0 to 9 only.</li> </ul> <h3>Disadvantages of BCD Codes</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The addition and subtraction of BCD have different rules.</p> </li> <li> <p>The BCD arithmetic is little more complicated.</p> </li> <li> <p>BCD needs more number of bits than binary to represent the decimal number. So BCD is less efficient than binary.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Alphanumeric codes</h2> <p>A binary digit or bit can represent only two symbols as it has only two states '0' or '1'. But this is not enough for communication between two computers because there we need many more symbols for communication. These symbols are required to represent 26 alphabets with capital and small letters, numbers from 0 to 9, punctuation marks and other symbols.</p> <p>The alphanumeric codes are the codes that represent numbers and alphabetic characters. Mostly such codes also represent other characters such as symbol and various instructions necessary for conveying information. An alphanumeric code should at least represent 10 digits and 26 letters of alphabet i.e. total 36 items. The following three alphanumeric codes are very commonly used for the data representation.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII).</li> <li>Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC).</li> <li>Five bit Baudot Code.</li> </ul> <p>ASCII code is a 7-bit code whereas EBCDIC is an 8-bit code. ASCII code is more commonly used worldwide while EBCDIC is used primarily in large IBM computers.</p> <h2>Error Codes</h2> <p>There are binary code techniques available to detect and correct data during data transmission.</p> <table class=\"table table-bordered\"> <tbody> <tr> <th width=\"38%\">Error Code</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Error Detection and Correction</p> </td> <td>Error de</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

Some of the characteristics of combinational circuits are following &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The output of combinational circuit at any instant of time, depends only on the levels present at input terminals.</p> </li> <li> <p>The combinational circuit do not use any memory.

The half adder circuit is designed to add two single bit binary number A and B. It is the basic building block for addition of two&nbsp;<strong>single</strong>&nbsp;bit numbers. This circuit has two outputs&nbsp;<strong>carry</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>sum</strong>.</p> <h3>Block diagram</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/halfadder_blockdiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Block Diagram of Half Adder\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h3>Truth Table</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/halfadder_truthtable.jpg\" alt=\"Half Adder Truth Table\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h3>Circuit Diagram</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/halfadder_circuitdiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Half Adder Circuit Diagram\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h2>Full Adder</h2> <p>Full adder is developed to overcome the drawback of Half Adder circuit. It can add two one-bit numbers A and B, and carry c. The full adder is a three input and two output combinational circuit.</p> <h3>Block diagram</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/fulladder_blockdiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Block Diagram of Full Adder\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h3>Truth Table</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/fulladder_truthtable.jpg\" alt=\"Full Adder Truth Table\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h3>Circuit Diagram</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/fulladder_circuitdiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Full Adder Circuit Diagram\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h2>N-Bit Parallel Adder</h2> <p>The Full Adder is capable of adding only two single digit binary number along with a carry input. But in practical we need to add binary numbers which are much longer than just one bit. To add two n-bit binary numbers we need to use the n-bit parallel adder. It uses a number of full adders in cascade. The carry output of the previous full adder is connected to carry input of the next full adder.</p> <h3>4 Bit Parallel Adder</h3> <p>In the block diagram, A<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;and B<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;represent the LSB of the four bit words A and B. Hence Full Adder-0 is the lowest stage. Hence its C<sub>in</sub>&nbsp;has been permanently made 0. The rest of the connections are exactly same as those of n-bit parallel adder is shown in fig. The four bit parallel adder is a very common logic circuit.</p> <h3>Block diagram</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/fourbitadder_blockdiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Block Diagram of Four bit Adder\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h2>N-Bit Parallel Subtractor</h2> <p>The subtraction can be carried out by taking the 1's or 2's complement of the number to be subtracted. For example we can perform the subtraction (A-B) by adding either 1's or 2's complement of B to A. That means we can use a binary adder to perform the binary subtraction.</p> <h3>4 Bit Parallel Subtractor</h3> <p>The number to be subtracted (B) is first passed through inverters to obtain its 1's complement. The 4-bit adder then adds A and 2's complement of B to produce the subtraction. S<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;S<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;S<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;S<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;represents the result of binary subtraction (A-B) and carry output C<sub>out</sub>&nbsp;represents the polarity of the result. If A &gt; B then Cout = 0 and the result of binary form (A-B) then C<sub>out</sub>&nbsp;= 1 and the result is in the 2's complement form.</p> <h3>Block diagram</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/fourbitsubstractor_blockdiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Block Diagram of Four bit Substrator\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h2>Half Subtractors</h2> <p>Half subtractor is a combination circuit with two inputs and two outputs (difference and borrow). It produces the difference between the two binary bits at the input and also produces an output (Borrow) to indicate if a 1 has been borrowed. In the subtraction (A-B), A is called as Minuend bit and B is called as Subtrahend bit.</p> <h3>Truth Table</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/halfsubstrator_truthtable.jpg\" alt=\"Half Substractor Truth Table\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h3>Circuit Diagram</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/halfsubstrator_circuitdiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Half Substractor Circuit Diagram\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h2>Full Subtractors</h2> <p>The disadvantage of a half subtractor is overcome by full subtractor. The full subtractor is a combinational circuit with three inputs A,B,C and two output D and C'. A is the 'minuend', B is 'subtrahend', C is the 'borrow' produced by the previous stage, D is the difference output and C' is the borrow output.</p> <h3>Truth Table</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/fullsubstrator_truthtable.jpg\" alt=\"Full Substractor Truth Table\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h3>Circuit Diagram</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/fullsubstrator_circuitdiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Full Substractor Circuit Diagram\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h2>Multiplexers</h2> <p>Multiplexer is a special type of combinational circuit. There are n-data inputs, one output and m select inputs with 2m = n. It is a digital circuit which selects one of the n data inputs and routes it to the output. The selection of one of the n inputs is done by the selected inputs. Depending on the digital code applied at the selected inputs, one out of n data sources is selected and transmitted to the single output Y. E is called the strobe or enable input which is useful for the cascading. It is generally an active low terminal that means it will perform the required operation when it is low.</p> <h3>Block diagram</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/n_onemultiplexer_blockdiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Block Diagram of n:1 Multiplexer\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>Multiplexers come in multiple variations</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>2 : 1 multiplexer</li> <li>4 : 1 multiplexer</li> <li>16 : 1 multiplexer</li> <li>32 : 1 multiplexer</li> </ul> <h3>Block Diagram</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/two_onemultiplexer_blockdiagram.jpg\" alt=\"2:1 Multiplexer Block Diagram\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h3>Truth Table</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/two_onemultiplexer_truthtable.jpg\" alt=\"2:1 Multiplexer Truth Table\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h2>Demultiplexers</h2> <p>A demultiplexer performs the reverse operation of a multiplexer i.e. it receives one input and distributes it over several outputs. It has only one input, n outputs, m select input. At a time only one output line is selected by the select lines and the input is transmitted to the selected output line. A de-multiplexer is equivalent to a single pole multiple way switch as shown in fig.</p> <p>Demultiplexers comes in multiple variations.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>1 : 2 demultiplexer</li> <li>1 : 4 demultiplexer</li> <li>1 : 16 demultiplexer</li> <li>1 : 32 demultiplexer</li> </ul> <h3>Block diagram</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/one_twodemultiplexer_blockdiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Block Diagram of 1:2 Demultiplexer\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h3>Truth Table</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/one_twodemultiplexer_truthtable.jpg\" alt=\"1:2 Demultiplexer Truth Table\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h2>Decoder</h2> <p>A decoder is a combinational circuit. It has n input and to a maximum m = 2n outputs. Decoder is identical to a demultiplexer without any data input. It performs operations which are exactly opposite to those of an encoder.</p> <h3>Block diagram</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/decoder_blockdiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Block Diagram of Decoder\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>Examples of Decoders are following.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Code converters</li> <li>BCD to seven segment decoders</li> <li>Nixie tube decoders</li> <li>Relay actuator</li> </ul> <h2>2 to 4 Line Decoder</h2> <p>The block diagram of 2 to 4 line decoder is shown in the fig. A and B are the two inputs where D through D are the four outputs. Truth table explains the operations of a decoder.

An encoder has n number of input lines and m number of output lines. An encoder produces an m bit binary code corresponding to the digital input number. The encoder accepts an n input digital word and converts it into an m bit another digital word.</p> <h3>Block diagram</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/encoder_blockdiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Block Diagram of encoder\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>Examples of Encoders are following.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Priority encoders</li> <li>Decimal to BCD encoder</li> <li>Octal to binary encoder</li> <li>Hexadecimal to binary encoder</li> </ul> <h2>Priority Encoder</h2> <p>This is a special type of encoder. Priority is given to the input lines. If two or more input line are 1 at the same time, then the input line with highest priority will be considered. There are four input D<sub>0</sub>, D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;and two output Y<sub>0</sub>, Y<sub>1</sub>. Out of the four input D<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;has the highest priority and D<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;has the lowest priority. That means if D<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;= 1 then Y<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;Y<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;= 11 irrespective of the other inputs. Similarly if D<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;= 0 and D<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;= 1 then Y<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;Y<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;= 10 irrespective of the other inputs.</p> <h3>Block diagram</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/priorityencoder_blockdiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Block Diagram of Priority Encoder\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h3>Truth Table</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/priorityencoder_truthtable.jpg\" alt=\"Truth Table of Priority Encoder\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <h3>Logic Circuit</h3> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/priorityencoder_logiccircuit.jpg\" alt=\"Logic Circuit of Priority Encoder\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></div> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

In short this circuit will operate as an S-R latch if E = 1 but there is no change in the output if E = 0.</p> <h3>Block Diagram</h3> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/srflipflop_blockdiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Block Diagram of SR Flip Flop\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h3>Circuit Diagram</h3> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/srflipflop_circuitdiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Circuit Diagram of SR Flip Flop\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h3>Truth Table</h3> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/srflipflop_truthtable.jpg\" alt=\"Truth Table of SR Flip Flop\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h3>Operation</h3> <table class=\"table table-bordered\"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.N.</th> <th>Condition</th> <th>Operation</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td><strong>S = R = 0 : No change</strong></td> <td> <p>If S = R = 0 then output of NAND gates 3 and 4 are forced to become 1.</p> <p>Hence R' and S' both will be equal to 1.

            "<h2>Memory Devices</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>A memory is just like a human brain. It is used to store data and instruction. Computer memory is the storage space in computer where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored.</p> <p>The memory is divided into large number of small parts. Each part is called a cell. Each location or cell has a unique address which varies from zero to memory size minus one.</p> <p>For example if computer has 64k words, then this memory unit has 64 * 1024 = 65536 memory location. The address of these locations varies from 0 to 65535.</p> <p>Memory is primarily of two types</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Internal Memory</strong>&nbsp;&minus; cache memory and primary/main memory</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>External Memory</strong>&nbsp;&minus; magnetic disk / optical disk etc.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/memory_hiearchy.jpg\" alt=\"Memory Hiearchy\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Characteristics of Memory Hierarchy are following when we go from top to bottom.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Capacity in terms of storage increases.</li> <li>Cost per bit of storage decreases.</li> <li>Frequency of access of the memory by the CPU decreases.</li> <li>Access time by the CPU increases.</li> </ul> <h2>RAM</h2> <p>A RAM constitutes the internal memory of the CPU for storing data, program and program result. It is read/write memory. It is called random access memory (RAM).</p> <p>Since access time in RAM is independent of the address to the word that is, each storage location inside the memory is as easy to reach as other location &amp; takes the same amount of time. We can reach into the memory at random &amp; extremely fast but can also be quite expensive.</p> <p>RAM is volatile, i.e. data stored in it is lost when we switch off the computer or if there is a power failure. Hence, a backup uninterruptible power system (UPS) is often used with computers. RAM is small, both in terms of its physical size and in the amount of data it can hold.</p> <p>RAM is of two types</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Static RAM (SRAM)</li> <li>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</li> </ul> <h3>Static RAM (SRAM)</h3> <p>The word&nbsp;<strong>static</strong>&nbsp;indicates that the memory retains its contents as long as power remains applied. However, data is lost when the power gets down due to volatile nature. SRAM chips use a matrix of 6-transistors and no capacitors. Transistors do not require power to prevent leakage, so SRAM need not have to be refreshed on a regular basis.</p> <p>Because of the extra space in the matrix, SRAM uses more chips than DRAM for the same amount of storage space, thus making the manufacturing costs higher.</p> <p>Static RAM is used as cache memory needs to be very fast and small.</p> <h3>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</h3> <p>DRAM, unlike SRAM, must be continually&nbsp;<strong>refreshed</strong>&nbsp;in order for it to maintain the data. This is done by placing the memory on a refresh circuit that rewrites the data several hundred times per second. DRAM is used for most system memory because it is cheap and small. All DRAMs are made up of memory cells. These cells are composed of one capacitor and one transistor.</p> <h2>ROM</h2> <p>ROM stands for Read Only Memory. The memory from which we can only read but cannot write on it. This type of memory is non-volatile. The information is stored permanently in such memories during manufacture.</p> <p>A ROM, stores such instruction as are required to start computer when electricity is first turned on, this operation is referred to as bootstrap. ROM chip are not only used in the computer but also in other electronic items like washing machine and microwave oven.</p> <p>Following are the various types of ROM &minus;</p> <h3>MROM (Masked ROM)</h3> <p>The very first ROMs were hard-wired devices that contained a pre-programmed set of data or instructions. These kind of ROMs are known as masked ROMs. It is inexpensive ROM.</p> <h3>PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory)</h3> <p>PROM is read-only memory that can be modified only once by a user. The user buys a blank PROM and enters the desired contents using a PROM programmer. Inside the PROM chip there are small fuses which are burnt open during programming. It can be programmed only once and is not erasable.</p> <h3>EPROM (Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory)</h3> <p>The EPROM can be erased by exposing it to ultra-violet light for a duration of upto 40 minutes. Usually, an EPROM eraser achieves this function. During programming an electrical charge is trapped in an insulated gate region. The charge is retained for more than ten years because the charge has no leakage path. For erasing this charge, ultra-violet light is passed through a quartz crystal window (lid). This exposure to ultra-violet light dissipates the charge. During normal use the quartz lid is sealed with a sticker.</p> <h3>EEPROM (Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory)</h3> <p>The EEPROM is programmed and erased electrically. It can be erased and reprogrammed about ten thousand times. Both erasing and programming take about 4 to 10 ms (millisecond). In EEPROM, any location can be selectively erased and programmed. EEPROMs can be erased one byte at a time, rather than erasing the entire chip. Hence, the process of re-programming is flexible but slow.</p> <h2>Serial Access Memory</h2> <p>Sequential access means the system must search the storage device from the beginning of the memory address until it finds the required piece of data. Memory device which supports such access is called a Sequential Access Memory or Serial Access Memory. Magnetic tape is an example of serial access memory.</p> <h2>Direct Access Memory</h2> <p>Direct access memory or Random Access Memory, refers to conditions in which a system can go directly to the information that the user wants. Memory device which supports such access is called a Direct Access Memory. Magnetic disks, optical disks are examples of direct access memory.</p> <h2>Cache Memory</h2> <p>Cache memory is a very high speed semiconductor memory which can speed up CPU. It acts as a buffer between the CPU and main memory. It is used to hold those parts of data and program which are most frequently used by CPU. The parts of data and programs, are transferred from disk to cache memory by operating system, from where CPU can access them.</p> <h3>Advantages</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Cache memory is faster than main memory.</li> <li>It consumes less access time as compared to main memory.</li> <li>It stores the program that can be executed within a short period of time.</li> <li>It stores data for temporary use.</li> </ul> <h3>Disadvantages</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Cache memory has limited capacity.</li> <li>It is very expensive.</li> </ul> <p>Virtual memory is a technique that allows the execution of processes which are not completely available in memory. The main visible advantage of this scheme is that programs can be larger than physical memory. Virtual memory is the separation of user logical memory from physical memory.</p> <p>This separation allows an extremely large virtual memory to be provided for programmers when only a smaller physical memory is available. Following are the situations, when entire program is not required to be loaded fully in main memory.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>User written error handling routines are used only when an error occurred in the data or computation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Certain options and features of a program may be used rarely.</p> </li> <li> <p>Many tables are assigned a fixed amount of address space even though only a small amount of the table is actually used.</p> </li> <li> <p>The ability to execute a program that is only partially in memory would counter many benefits.</p> </li> <li> <p>Less number of I/O would be needed to load or swap each user program into memory.</p> </li> <li> <p>A program would no longer be constrained by the amount of physical memory that is available.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each user program could take less physical memory, more programs could be run the same time, with a corresponding increase in CPU utilization and throughput.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Auxiliary Memory</h2> <p>Auxiliary memory is much larger in size than main memory but is slower. It normally stores system programs, instruction and data files. It is also known as secondary memory. It can also be used as an overflow/virtual memory in case the main memory capacity has been exceeded. Secondary memories cannot be accessed directly by a processor. First the data/information of auxiliary memory is transferred to the main memory and then that information can be accessed by the CPU. Characteristics of Auxiliary Memory are following &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Non-volatile memory</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Data is not lost when power is cut off.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Reusable</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The data stays in the secondary storage on permanent basis until it is not overwritten or deleted by the user.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Reliable</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Data in secondary storage is safe because of high physical stability of secondary storage device.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Convenience</strong>&nbsp;&minus; With the help of a computer software, authorised people can locate and access the data quickly.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Capacity</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Secondary storage can store large volumes of data in sets of multiple disks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Cost</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is much lesser expensive to store data on a tape or disk than primary memory.</p> </li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

The instruction is divided into group of bits called field. The way instruction is expressed is known as instruction format. It is usually represented in the form of rectangular box. The instruction format may be of the following types.</p> <h2>Variable Instruction Formats</h2> <p>These are the instruction formats in which the instruction length varies on the basis of opcode &amp; address specifiers. For Example, VAX instruction vary between 1 and 53 bytes while X86 instruction vary between 1 and 17 bytes.</p> <h3>Format</h3> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/variable_instruction_format.jpg\" alt=\"Variable Instruction Format\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h3>Advantage</h3> <p>These formats have good code density.</p> <h3>Drawback</h3> <p>These instruction formats are very difficult to decode and pipeline.</p> <h2>Fixed Instruction Formats</h2> <p>In this type of instruction format, all instructions are of same size.

Operated data is stored in the memory location, each instruction required certain data on which it has to operate. There are various techniques to specify address of data. These techniques are called Addressing Modes.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Direct addressing mode</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In the direct addressing mode, address of the operand is given in the instruction and data is available in the memory location which is provided in instruction. We will move this data in desired location.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Indirect addressing mode</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In the indirect addressing mode, the instruction specifies a register which contain the address of the operand. Both internal RAM and external RAM can be accessed via indirect addressing mode.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Immediate addressing mode</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In the immediate addressing mode, direct data is given in the operand which move the data in accumulator. It is very fast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Relative addressing mode</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In the relative address mode, the effective address is determined by the index mode by using the program counter in stead of general purpose processor register. This mode is called relative address mode.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Index addressing mode</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In the index address mode, the effective address of the operand is generated by adding a content value to the contents of the register. This mode is called index address mode.</p> </li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

In a similar way, if you delete a character and you want to delete more characters then you can use the&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>&nbsp;operation.</p> <h2>How to use Undo &amp; Repeat operations</h2> <p>You can access the Undo and Repeat buttons from the Quick Access toolbar. You should make a note that the&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>&nbsp;button is also called&nbsp;<strong>Redo</strong>&nbsp;button and both the operations have the same meaning.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/undo_button.jpg\" alt=\"Undo and Repeat Buttons\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Here is the simple procedure to apply&nbsp;<strong>undo</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>repeat</strong>&nbsp;(redo) operations &minus;</p> <p><strong>Step 1</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Let us type some text in a blank document. Now click the&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>(Redo) button and you will see that Word will repeat the same operation for you.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/repeat_operation.jpg\" alt=\"Repeat Operation\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Now to examine the&nbsp;<strong>undo</strong>&nbsp;operation, let us delete the last word&nbsp;<strong>operation</strong>&nbsp;character by character so that you have the following text remaining in the line.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/undo_operation.jpg\" alt=\"Undo Operation\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p><strong>Step 3</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Let us try to click the&nbsp;<strong>Undo</strong>&nbsp;button one by one. You will see that Word will recover all the deleted characters one by one after performing a few undo operations.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/undo_operation2.jpg\" alt=\"Undo Operation2\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Shortcuts to use Undo &amp; Repeat operations</h2> <p>Though you can access the&nbsp;<strong>Undo</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>&nbsp;commands from the Quick Access toolbar, but because these commands are the most frequently used commands, we recommend you memorize their keyboard shortcuts which are as follows &minus;</p> <table class=\"table table-bordered\"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.No</th> <th>Shortcuts &amp; Operation</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td> <p><strong>Ctrl + Z</strong></p> <p>Undoes the previous action.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td> <p><strong>Ctrl + Y</strong></p> <p>Repeats the previous action.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Note that if the previous action was Undo,&nbsp;<strong>Ctrl+Y</strong>&nbsp;redoes the Undone action.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

			"<head> <title>Adding Text in Boxes</title><h2>Adding Text in Boxes</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>PowerPoint allows users to add text to the slide in a well-defined manner to ensure the content is well distributed and easy to read. The procedure to add the text in a PowerPoint slide is always the same - just click in the text box and start typing. The text will follow the default formatting set for the text box, although this formatting can be changed later as required. What changes is the different kinds of content boxes that support text in a PowerPoint slide.</p> <p>Given below are some of the most common content blocks you will see in PowerPoint.</p> <h2>Title Box</h2> <p>This is typically found on slides with the title layout and in all the slides that have a title box in them. This box is indicated by \"<strong>Click to add title</strong>\".</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/title_slide.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Subtitle Box</h2> <p>This is found only in slides with the&nbsp;<strong>Title</strong>&nbsp;layout. This is indicated by \"<strong>Click to add subtitle</strong>\"</p> <h2>Content Box</h2> <p>This is found in most of the slides that have a placeholder for adding content. This is indicated by \"<strong>Click to add text</strong>\". As you can see, this box allows you to add text as well as non-text content. To add text to such a box, click anywhere on the box, except on one of the content icons in the center and start typing.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/content_slide.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Text Only Box</h2> <p>This is not a default content box available in PowerPoint, but you can create it using Slide Master, if required. This is also indicated by \"<strong>Click to add text</strong>\". The only difference between the&nbsp;<strong>Text Only Box</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>Content Box</strong>&nbsp;is that the former only supports text in the content area.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/text_only_slide.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",

			"<head> <title>Managing Sections</title><h2>Managing Sections</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Given the popularity of PowerPoint and its versatility, there are situations when you are dealing with very large slide decks or just collaborating with different people to build the slides. In such cases, it is always helpful to be able to segregate the slides into smaller groups and work with these groups. PowerPoint 2010 introduces the concept of sections to achieve this. Here are the main functions you can execute with sections.</p> <h2>Creating Sections</h2> <p>The steps to create a new section are as follows. You can execute these steps from the Normal view or the Slide Sorter view.</p> <p><strong>Step 1</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In the&nbsp;<strong>Normal</strong>&nbsp;view or the&nbsp;<strong>Slide Sorter</strong>&nbsp;view, right-click at the position where you want to add the section and select&nbsp;<strong>add section</strong>.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/adding_new_section_normal.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/adding_new_section_slide_sorter.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The new section gets added to the presentation with all the subsequent slides being included in this section.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/new_section_normal.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/new_section_slide_sorter.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p><strong>Step 3</strong>&nbsp;&minus; By default, the new section is named \"<strong>Untitled Section</strong>\" but you can change the section name. Right-click on the section and select \"<strong>Rename Section</strong>\".</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/rename_section_normal.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/rename_section_slide_sorter.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p><strong>Step 4</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In the&nbsp;<strong>Rename Section</strong>&nbsp;dialog box, enter the new section name. This accepts all the characters including alphabets, numbers, special characters, punctuations, etc.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/rename_section_dialog.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p><strong>Step 5</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Click on the \"<strong>Rename</strong>\" button on the dialog to rename the section.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/new_section_name_normal.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/new_section_name_slide_sorter.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Rearranging Sections</h2> <p>One of the advantages of sections is that you can not only group slides together, but also rearrange them as one set. Instead of having to move each slide individually, you can move the entire section. Just like rearranging slides you can drag and move the sections. Alternately, you can right-click on the section and move it up or down as shown below.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/rearrange_sections.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>If there are many slides to work with, you can collapse them so you view just the sections. This makes rearranging them less confusing too.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/expand_collapse.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/collapsed_sections_normal.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/collapsed_sections_slide_sorter.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Deleting Sections</h2> <p>PowerPoint 2010 provides three options to delete sections. The table below explains the function of each option.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/delete_sections.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <table class=\"table table-bordered\"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.No</th> <th>Delete Option &amp; Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"ts\">1</td> <td> <p><strong>Remove Section</strong></p> <p>Deletes the selected section and merges slides with the previous section.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"ts\">2</td> <td> <p><strong>Remove Section &amp; Slide</strong></p> <p>Deletes the selected section and all the slides in the section.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"ts\">3</td> <td> <p><strong>Remove All Sections</strong></p> <p>Deletes all the sections and merges all the slides into a presentation without sections.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Working With Outlines</title><h2>Working With Outlines</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>PowerPoint is a great program that allows you to bring together text, images, shapes and multimedia. However, sometimes you may just want to review the text without focusing on the non-text aspects of the slide deck. This is where the&nbsp;<strong>Outline</strong>&nbsp;view in PowerPoint is quite useful. The Outline view can be accessed from the tab adjacent to the Slide tab in the&nbsp;<strong>Normal</strong>&nbsp;view.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/outline_tab.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>The outline view shows just the text content from various slides.

However, you can drag the pane out to increase the size to improve readability.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/outline_pane.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Sidebars</title><h2>Sidebars</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>PowerPoint slides have a left-hand side bar which offers two invaluable views.

You can select individual slides from this tab and also perform some tasks like changing slide layouts, reordering slides, inserting new slides, deleting slides, etc. Although you cannot edit the slide contents from this tab, you can select the slide and make edits from the slide displayed to the right.</p> <h2>Outline Tab</h2> <p>This is the tab right next to the Slides tab and as the name suggests, this provides the outline for the slide. This section just displays all the textual content from every slide - this can be very useful if there is a lot of non-text content in the slide and reviewing just the written part gets difficult. Unlike in the slides tab, you can edit the text from this section.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/screens/outline_tab_image.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>If you need greater viewing space, you can close the sidebar by click on the X on the top right of this bar.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/screens/closing_sidebar.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>To recover the sidebar, just click on the&nbsp;<strong>Normal</strong>&nbsp;view icon again.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/screens/normal_view_sidebar_recover_icon.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",

Typically, when you run the slideshow, the presentation takes up the entire screen so other applications cannot be accessed from the taskbar. In the reading view the taskbar is still available while viewing the slideshow which is convenient. You cannot make any modifications when on this view.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/reading_view.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>SlidesShow</h2> <p>This is the traditional slideshow view available in all the earlier versions of PowerPoint.

In the landscape layout, the longer edge is horizontal so the slides align better with the screens and projectors.</p> <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Portrait</strong>&nbsp;layout is where the shorter edge is horizontal. This is sometimes better for print depending on the kind of content you want to present.</p> <p>Slide orientations in PowerPoint can be changed from the&nbsp;<strong>Design</strong>&nbsp;ribbon using the&nbsp;<strong>Slide</strong>&nbsp;Orientation command.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/slide_orientation.jpg\" alt=\"Office 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",

PowerPoint offers to the users a wide range of options when it comes to duplicating content. PowerPoint has the standard cut and copy functions but allows variations of paste options.</p> <h2>Cut Option</h2> <p>This option allows you to cut content from the slide - this means the original content is being moved to a different location hence the content will be deleted from its original location when you use this option. To cut a content, you need to select it and press \"Ctrl + X\" or right-click on the selected content and select&nbsp;<strong>Cut</strong>.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/cut_copy_menu_options.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Copy Option</h2> <p>This option allows you to copy content from one location to another; hence the original content is retained it its place while the duplicate content can be pasted. To copy a portion of content, you need to select it and press \"Ctrl + C\" or right-click on the selected content and select&nbsp;<strong>Copy</strong>.</p> <h2>Paste Option</h2> <p>This option allows you to paste the cut or copied content at the desired location. There are multiple paste options for you to choose from. These options are indicated by different icons when you right-click at the desired location. Even if you do not remember the icons, you can hover your cursor on top of them for tooltip explanations. The table below describes the paste options in PowerPoint.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/paste_menu_options.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <table class=\"table table-bordered\"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.No</th> <th>Paste Option &amp; Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"ts\">1</td> <td> <p><strong>Destination Theme</strong></p> <p>Pasted content adopts the destination theme.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"ts\">2</td> <td> <p><strong>Keep Source Formatting</strong></p> <p>Pasted content retains the source formatting - available for table or Excel content.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"ts\">3</td> <td> <p><strong>Picture</strong></p> <p>Content is pasted as an image - once pasted as an image, the content cannot be modified.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"ts\">4</td> <td> <p><strong>Keep Text Only</strong></p> <p>Pastes just the text - available for table or Excel content.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>You can also paste content using \"<strong>Ctrl + V</strong>\". In this case, you can make changes to the pasted object by pressing the Ctrl key to get access to the paste options. Note that these options are available only immediately after pasting.

			"<head> <title>Creating Formulas in Excel</title><h2>Creating Formulas in Excel</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <h2>Formulas in MS Excel</h2> <p>Formulas are the Bread and butter of worksheet. Without formula, worksheet will be just simple tabular representation of data. A formula consists of special code, which is entered into a cell. It performs some calculations and returns a result, which is displayed in the cell.</p> <p>Formulas use a variety of operators and worksheet functions to work with values and text. The values and text used in formulas can be located in other cells, which makes changing data easy and gives worksheets their dynamic nature. For example, you can quickly change the data in a worksheet and formulas works.</p> <h2>Elements of Formulas</h2> <p>A formula can consist of any of these elements &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Mathematical operators, such as +(for addition) and *(for multiplication)</strong></p> <p><strong>Example &minus;</strong></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>=A1+A2 Adds the values in cells A1 and A2.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Values or text</strong></p> <p><strong>Example &minus;</strong></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>=200*0.5 Multiplies 200 times 0.15. This formula uses only values, and it always returns the same result as 100.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Cell references (including named cells and ranges)</strong></p> <p><strong>Example</strong>&nbsp;&minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>=A1=C12 Compares cell A1 with cell C12. If the cells are identical, the formula returns TRUE; otherwise, it returns FALSE.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Worksheet functions (such as SUMor AVERAGE)</strong></p> <p><strong>Example</strong>&nbsp;&minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>=SUM(A1:A12) Adds the values in the range A1:A12.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Creating Formula</h2> <p>For creating a formula you need to type in the Formula Bar. Formula begins with '=' sign. When building formulas manually, you can either type in the cell addresses or you can point to them in the worksheet. Using the&nbsp;<strong>Pointing method</strong>&nbsp;to supply the cell addresses for formulas is often easier and more powerful method of formula building. When you are using built-in functions, you click the cell or drag through the cell range that you want to use when defining the function&rsquo;s arguments in the Function Arguments dialog box. See the below screen shot.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/excel/images/formula_intro.jpg\" alt=\"Introduction to formula\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>As soon as you complete a formula entry, Excel calculates the result, which is then displayed inside the cell within the worksheet (the contents of the formula, however, continue to be visible on the Formula bar anytime the cell is active). If you make an error in the formula that prevents Excel from being able to calculate the formula at all, Excel displays an Alert dialog box suggesting how to fix the problem.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Copying Formulas in Excel</title><h2>Copying Formulas in Excel</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <h2>Copying Formulas in MS Excel</h2> <p>Copying formulas is one of the most common tasks that you do in a typical spreadsheet that relies primarily on formulas. When a formula uses cell references rather than constant values, Excel makes the task of copying an original formula to every place that requires a similar formula.</p> <h2>Relative Cell Addresses</h2> <p>MS Excel does it automatically adjusting the cell references in the original formula to suit the position of the copies that you make. It does this through a system known as&nbsp;<strong>relative cell addresses,</strong>&nbsp;where by the column references in the cell address in the formula change to suit their new column position and the row references change to suit their new row position.</p> <p>Let us see this with the help of example. Suppose we want the sum of all the rows at last, then we will write a formula for first column i.e. B. We want sum of the rows from 3 to 8 in the 9<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;row.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/excel/images/formula.jpg\" alt=\"Writing Formula\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>After writing formula in the 9<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;row, we can drag it to remaining columns and the formula gets copied. After dragging we can see the formula in the remaining columns as below.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>column C :</strong>&nbsp;=SUM(C3:C8)</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>column D :</strong>&nbsp;=SUM(D3:D8)</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>column E :</strong>&nbsp;=SUM(E3:E8)</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>column F :</strong>&nbsp;=SUM(F3:F8)</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>column G :</strong>&nbsp;=SUM(G3:G8)</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/excel/images/copied_formula.jpg\" alt=\"Copy Formula using Cell referencing\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Formula Reference in Excel</title><h2>Formula Reference in Excel</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <h2>Cell References in Formulas</h2> <p>Most formulas you create include references to cells or ranges. These references enable your formulas to work dynamically with the data contained in those cells or ranges. For example, if your formula refers to cell C2 and you change the value contained in C2, the formula result reflects new value automatically. If you didn&rsquo;t use references in your formulas, you would need to edit the formulas themselves in order to change the values used in the formulas.</p> <p>When you use a cell (or range) reference in a formula, you can use three types of references &minus; relative, absolute, and mixed references.</p> <h2>Relative Cell References</h2> <p>The row and column references can change when you copy the formula to another cell because the references are actually offsets from the current row and column. By default, Excel creates relative cell references in formulas.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/excel/images/relative_ref.jpg\" alt=\"Relative references\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Absolute Cell References</h2> <p>The row and column references do not change when you copy the formula because the reference is to an actual cell address. An absolute reference uses two dollar signs in its address: one for the column letter and one for the row number (for example, $A$5).</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/excel/images/abs_ref.jpg\" alt=\"Absolute References\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Mixed Cell References</h2> <p>Both the row or column reference is relative and the other is absolute. Only one of the address parts is absolute (for example, $A5 or A$5).</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/excel/images/mixed_ref.jpg\" alt=\"Mixed References\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Using Functions in Excel</title><h2>Using Functions in Excel</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <h2>Functions in Formula</h2> <p>Many formulas you create use available worksheet functions. These functions enable you to greatly enhance the power of your formulas and perform calculations that are difficult if you use only the operators. For example, you can use the LOG or SIN function to calculate the Logarithm or Sin ratio. You can&rsquo;t do this complicated calculation by using the mathematical operators alone.</p> <h2>Using Functions</h2> <p>When you type = sign and then type any alphabet you will see the searched functions as below.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/excel/images/function_intro.jpg\" alt=\"Function Introduction\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Suppose you need to determine the largest value in a range. A formula can&rsquo;t tell you the answer without using a function. We will use formula that uses the MAX function to return the largest value in the range B3:B8 as&nbsp;<strong>=MAX(A1:D100)</strong>.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/excel/images/function_use.jpg\" alt=\"Use function in Formula\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Another example of functions. Suppose you want to find if the cell of month is greater than 1900 then we can give Bonus to Sales representative.

The information inside the parentheses is the list of arguments.</p> <p>Functions vary in how they use arguments.

			"<head> <title>Cross Referencing in Excel</title><h2>Cross Referencing in Excel</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <h2>Graphic Objects in MS Excel</h2> <p>When you have information spread across several different spreadsheets, it can seem a daunting task to bring all these different sets of data together into one meaningful list or table. This is where the Vlookup function comes into its own.</p> <h2>VLOOKUP</h2> <p>VlookUp searches for a value vertically down for the lookup table. VLOOKUP(lookup_value,table_array,col_index_num,range_lookup) has 4 parameters as below.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>lookup_value</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is the user input. This is the value that the function uses to search on.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>The table_array</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is the area of cells in which the table is located. This includes not only the column being searched on, but the data columns for which you are going to get the values that you need.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Col_index_num</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is the column of data that contains the answer that you want.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Range_lookup</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is a TRUE or FALSE value. When set to TRUE, the lookup function gives the closest match to the lookup_value without going over the lookup_value. When set to FALSE, an exact match must be found to the lookup_value or the function will return #N/A. Note, this requires that the column containing the lookup_value be formatted in ascending order.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>VLOOKUP Example</h2> <p>Let's look at a very simple example of cross-referencing two spreadsheets. Each spreadsheet contains information about the same group of people. The first spreadsheet has their dates of birth, and the second shows their favorite color. How do we build a list showing the person's name, their date of birth and their favorite color? VLOOOKUP will help in this case. First of all, let us see data in both the sheets.</p> <p>This is data in the first sheet</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/excel/images/data_first_sheet.jpg\" alt=\"Data in First Sheet\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>This is data in the second sheet</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/excel/images/data_second_sheet.jpg\" alt=\"Data in Second Sheet\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Now for finding the respective favorite color for that person from another sheet we need to vlookup the data. First argument to the VLOOKUP is lookup value (In this case it is person name). Second argument is the table array, which is table in the second sheet from B2 to C11. Third argument to VLOOKUP is Column index num, which is the answer we are looking for. In this case, it is 2 the color column number is 2. The fourth argument is True returning partial match or false returning exact match. After applying VLOOKUP formula it will calculate the color and the results are displayed as below.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/excel/images/vlookup_results.jpg\" alt=\"VLOOKUP results\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>As you can see in the above screen-shot that results of VLOOKUP has searched for color in the second sheet table. It has returned #N/A in case where match is not found. In this case, Andy's data is not present in the second sheet so it returned #N/A.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",

			"<head> <title>Workbook Security in Excel</title><h2>Workbook Security in Excel</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <h2>Workbook Security</h2> <p>We can apply security to the workbook by the concept of protection available in the Review Tab of ribbon. MS Excel's protection-related features fall into three categories.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Worksheet protection</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Protecting a worksheet from being modified, or restricting the modifications to certain users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Workbook protection</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Protecting a workbook from having sheets inserted or deleted, and also requiring the use of password to open the workbook.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Protect Worksheet</h2> <p>You may want to protect a worksheet for a variety of reasons. One reason is to prevent yourself or others from accidentally deleting the formulas or other critical data. A common scenario is to protect a worksheet, so that the data can be changed, but the formulas can&rsquo;t be changed.</p> <p>To protect a worksheet, choose&nbsp;<strong>Review &raquo; Changes group &raquo; Protect Sheet</strong>. Excel displays the Protect Sheet dialog box. Note that providing a password is optional. If you enter a password, that password will be required to unprotect the worksheet. You can select various options in which the sheet should be protected. Suppose we checked Format Cells option then Excel will not allow to format cells.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/excel/images/protect_sheet.jpg\" alt=\"Protect sheet\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>When somebody tries to format the cells, he or she will get the error as shown in the screenshot below.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/excel/images/protected_sheet.jpg\" alt=\"Protected sheet Error\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>To unprotect a protected sheet, choose&nbsp;<strong>Review &raquo; Changes group &raquo; Unprotect Sheet</strong>. If the sheet was protected with a password, you&rsquo;re prompted to enter that password.</p> <h2>Protecting a Workbook</h2> <p>Excel provides three ways to protect a workbook.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Requires a password to open the workbook.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prevents the users from adding sheets, deleting sheets, hiding sheets, and unhiding sheets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prevents users from changing the size or position of windows.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Requiring a Password to Open a Workbook</h2> <p>Excel lets you save a workbook with a password. After doing so, whoever tries to open the workbook, must enter the password. To add a password to a workbook, follow these steps.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Choose&nbsp;<strong>File &raquo; Info &raquo; Protect Workbook &raquo; Encrypt With Password</strong>. Excel displays the Encrypt Document dialog box.</p> </li> <li> <p>Type a password and click OK.</p> </li> <li> <p>Type the password again and click OK.</p> </li> <li> <p>Save the workbook.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/excel/images/encrypt_with_pass.jpg\" alt=\"Encrypt with Password\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>To remove a password from a workbook, repeat the same procedure. In Step 2, however, delete the existing password symbols.</p> <h2>Protecting Workbook&rsquo;s Structure and Windows</h2> <p>To prevent others (or yourself) from performing certain actions in a workbook, you can protect the workbook&rsquo;s structure and windows. When a workbook&rsquo;s structure and windows are protected, the user may not Add a sheet, Delete a sheet, Hide a sheet, unhide a sheet, etc., and may not be allowed to change the size or position of a workbook&rsquo;s windows respectively.</p> <p>To protect a worksheet&rsquo;s structure and windows, follow the below mentioned steps.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Review &raquo; Changes group &raquo; Protect Workbook</strong>&nbsp;to display the Protect Workbook dialog box.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the Protect Workbook dialog box, select the Structure check box and Windows check box.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Enter a password.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click OK.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/excel/images/protect_workbook.jpg\" alt=\"Protect Workbook\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",

This tutorial is done mainly for people that are within the IT industry who are IT specialists, System administrators, Security administrators.</p> <h2>Why Security?</h2> <p>Cyberspace (internet, work environment, intranet) is becoming a dangerous place for all organizations and individuals to protect their sensitive data or reputation. This is because of the numerous people and machines accessing it. It is important to mention that the recent studies have shown a big danger is coming from internal threats or from disappointed employees like the Edward Snowden case, another internal threat is that information material can be easy accessible over the intranet.</p> <p>One important indicator is the IT skills of a person that wants to hack or to breach your security has decreased but the success rate of it has increased, this is because of three main factors &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Hacking tools that can be found very easily by everyone just by googling and they are endless.</p> </li> <li> <p>Technology with the end-users has increased rapidly within these years, like internet bandwidth and computer processing speeds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Access to hacking information manuals.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All this can make even a school boy with the curiosity, a potential hacker for your organization.</p> <p>Since locking down all networks is not an available option, the only response the security managers can give is to harden their networks, applications and operating systems to a reasonable level of safety, and conducting a business disaster recovery plan.</p> <p>The following graph gives us a basic idea.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/correlation_graph.jpg\" alt=\"Correlation Graph\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>What to Secure?</h2> <p>Let&rsquo;s see this case, you are an IT administrator in a small company having two small servers staying in a corner and you are very good at your job. You are doing updates regularly, setting up firewalls, antiviruses, etc. One day, you see that the organization employees are not accessing the systems anymore. When you go and check, you see the cleaning lady doing her job and by mistake, she had removed the power cable and unplugged the server.</p> <p>What I mean by this case is that even physical security is important in computer security, as most of us think it is the last thing to take care of.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/to_make_secure.jpg\" alt=\"To make Secure\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Now let&rsquo;s go directly to the point of what all to secure in a computer environment &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>First of all, is to check the physical security by setting control systems like motion alarms, door accessing systems, humidity sensors, temperature sensors. All these components decrease the possibility of a computer to be stolen or damaged by humans and environment itself.</p> </li> <li> <p>People having access to computer systems should have their own user id with password protection.</p> </li> <li> <p>Monitors should be screen saver protected to hide the information from being displayed when the user is away or inactive.</p> </li> <li> <p>Secure your network especially wireless, passwords should be used.</p> </li> <li> <p>Internet equipment as routers to be protected with password.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data that you use to store information which can be financial, or non-financial by encryption.</p> </li> <li> <p>Information should be protected in all types of its representation in transmission by encrypting it.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Benefits of Computer Security Awareness</h2> <p><em>Do you know in all this digital world, what is the biggest hole or the weakest point of the security?</em></p> <p><em>Answer. It is us, humans.</em></p> <p>Most of the security breaches come from uninformed and untrained persons which give information to a third party or publish data in Internet without knowing the consequences.</p> <p>See the following scenario which tells us what employees might end up doing without computer security awareness &minus;</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/computer_security_awareness.jpg\" alt=\"Computer Security Awareness\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>So the benefits of computer security awareness are obvious as it directly minimizes the potential of you being hacked off your identity, your computer, your organization.</p> <h2>Potential Losses due to Security Attacks</h2> <p>The potential loses in this cyberspace are many even if you are using a single computer in your room. Here, I will be listing some examples that have a direct impact on you and on others &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Losing you data</strong>&nbsp;&minus; If your computer has been hacked or infected, there is a big chance that all your stored data might be taken by the attacker.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bad usage of your computer resources</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This means that your network or computer can go in overload so you cannot access your genuine services or in a worst case scenario, it can be used by the hacker to attack another machine or network.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Reputation loss</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Just think if your Facebook account or business email has been owned by a social engineering attack and it sends fake information to your friends, business partners. You will need time to gain back your reputation.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Identity theft</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This is a case where your identity is stolen (photo, name surname, address, and credit card) and can be used for a crime like making false identity documents.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/sign_in_account.jpg\" alt=\"Sign in Account\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Basic Computer Security Checklist</h2> <p>There are some basic things that everyone of us in every operating system need to do &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Check if the user is password protected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Check if the operating system is being updated. In my case, I did a screenshot of my laptop which is a Windows 7.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/windows_update.jpg\" alt=\"Windows Update\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Check if the antivirus or antimalware is installed and updated. In my case, I have a Kaspersky antivirus being updated.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/kaspersky.jpg\" alt=\"Kaspersky\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Check for the unusual services running that consumes resources.</li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/windows_task_manager.jpg\" alt=\"Windows Task Manager\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Check if your monitor is using a screen saver.</li> <li>Check if the computer firewall is on or not.</li> <li>Check if you are doing backups regularly.</li> <li>Check if there are shares that are not useful.</li> <li>Check if your account has full rights or is restricted.</li> <li>Update other third party software&rsquo;s.</li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

            "<h2>Elements</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>The general state in Computer Security has the ability to detect and prevent attacks and to be able to recover. If these attacks are successful as such then it has to contain the disruption of information and services and check if they are kept low or tolerable.</p> <h2>Different Elements in Computer Security</h2> <p>In order to fulfil these requirements, we come to the three main elements which are&nbsp;<strong>confidentiality, integrity</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>availability</strong>&nbsp;and the recently added&nbsp;<strong>authenticity and utility</strong>.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/different_elements.jpg\" alt=\"Different Elements\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Confidentiality</h2> <p>Confidentiality is the concealment of information or resources. Also, there is a need to keep information secret from other third parties that want to have access to it, so just the right people can access it.</p> <p><strong>Example in real life</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Let&rsquo;s say there are two people communicating via an encrypted email they know the decryption keys of each other and they read the email by entering these keys into the email program. If someone else can read these decryption keys when they are entered into the program, then the confidentiality of that email is compromised.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/confidentiality.jpg\" alt=\"Confidentiality\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Integrity</h2> <p>Integrity is the trustworthiness of data in the systems or resources by the point of view of preventing unauthorized and improper changes. Generally, Integrity is composed of two sub-elements &ndash; data-integrity, which it has to do with the content of the data and authentication which has to do with the origin of the data as such information has values only if it is correct.</p> <p><strong>Example in real life</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Let&rsquo;s say you are doing an online payment of 5 USD, but your information is tampered without your knowledge in a way by sending to the seller 500 USD, this would cost you too much.</p> <p>In this case cryptography plays a very major role in ensuring data integrity. Commonly used methods to protect data integrity includes hashing the data you receive and comparing it with the hash of the original message. However, this means that the hash of the original data must be provided in a secure way.</p> <h2>Availability</h2> <p>Availability refers to the ability to access data of a resource when it is needed, as such the information has value only if the authorized people can access at right time. Denying access to data nowadays has become a common attack. Imagine a downtime of a live server how costly it can be.</p> <p><strong>Example in real life</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Let&rsquo;s say a hacker has compromised a webserver of a bank and put it down. You as an authenticated user want to do an e-banking transfer but it is impossible to access it, the undone transfer is a money lost for the bank.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

            "<h2>Malwares</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>In the previous chapter we treated antiviruses which helped us to protect our systems but in this chapter we will treat malwares, how to detect them manually, what are their forms, what are their file extensions, signs of an infected computer, etc. They are important to be treated because the infection rates of businesses and personal computers are too high in nowadays.</p> <p>They are self-replication programs that reproduce their own codes by attaching themselves to other executable codes. They operate without the permissions or knowledge of the computer users. Viruses or malwares like in real-life, in computers they contaminate other healthy files.</p> <p>However, we should remember that viruses infect outside machines only with the assistance of a computer user only. These can happen by clicking a file that comes attached with email from an unknown person, plugging a USB without scanning, opening unsafe URLs for that reason. We as system administrators have to remove the administrator permissions of users in these computers. We categorize malwares in three types &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Trojans and Rootkits</li> <li>Viruses</li> <li>Worms</li> </ul> <h2>Characteristics of a Virus</h2> <p>Following are a couple of characteristics of any virus that infects our computers.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>They reside in a computer&rsquo;s memory and activates themselves while the program that is attached starts running.</p> <p><strong>For example</strong>&nbsp;&minus; They attach themselves in general to the&nbsp;<strong>explorer.exe</strong>&nbsp;in windows OS because it is the process that is running all the time, so you should be cautious when this process starts to consume too much of your computer capacities.</p> </li> <li> <p>They modify themselves after the infection phase like they source codes, extensions, new files, etc. so it is harder for an antivirus to detect them.</p> </li> <li> <p>They always try to hide themselves in the operating systems in the following ways &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Encrypts itself into cryptic symbols, and they decrypt themselves when they replicate or execute.</p> <p><strong>For example</strong>&nbsp;&minus; You can see this in the following image for better understanding as in my computer I found this file.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/virus_attack.jpg\" alt=\"Virus Attack\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>After finding this file, I opened it with a text editor and as thought the text was not understandable as shown in the following screenshot.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>After finding this, I tried it on a base64 decoder and I found that it was a Virus file.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/virus_file.jpg\" alt=\"Virus file\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>This virus can cause the following to your computer &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>It may delete important data from your computer to gain space for their processes.</p> </li> <li> <p>It may avoid detection by redirection of disk data.</p> </li> <li> <p>It may perform tasks by triggering an event with itself. For example, this happens when in an infected computer pop-up tables etc., show up automatically on the screen.</p> </li> <li> <p>They are common in Windows and Mac OS because these operation systems do not have multiple file permissions and are more spread out.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Working Process of Malwares and how to Clean it</h2> <p>Malwares attach themselves to programs and transmit to other programs by making use of some events, they need these events to happen because they cannot &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Start by themselves</li> <li>Transmit themselves by using non-executable files</li> <li>Infect other networks or computer</li> </ul> <p>From the above conclusions, we should know that when some unusual processes or services are run by themselves we should further investigate their relations with a possible virus. The investigation process is as follows &minus;</p> <p>To investigate these processes, start with the use of the following tools &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>fport.exe</li> <li>pslist.exe</li> <li>handle.exe</li> <li>netstat.exe</li> </ul> <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Listdll.exe</strong>&nbsp;shows all the&nbsp;<strong>dll files</strong>&nbsp;being used, while the&nbsp;<strong>netstat.exe</strong>&nbsp;with its variables shows all the processes that are being run with their respective ports.</p> <p>You can see the following example on how I mapped the process of Kaspersky antivirus which I used along with the command&nbsp;<strong>netstat-ano</strong>&nbsp;to see the process numbers and task manager to see to which process belongs to this number.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/working_process_of_malwares.jpg\" alt=\"Working Process of Malwares\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Then we should look for any&nbsp;<strong>modified, replaced or deleted files</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>shared libraries</strong>&nbsp;should also be checked. They generally infect executable program files with extension like&nbsp;<strong>.EXE, .DRV, .SYS, .COM, .BIN</strong>. Malwares changes extension of genuine files, for example: File.TXT to File.TXT.VBS.</p> <p>If you are a system administrator of a webserver, then you should be aware of another form of malware which is called as&nbsp;<strong>webshell</strong>. It generally is in a .php extension but with strange file names and in an encrypted form. You should delete them in case you detect them.</p> <p>After that is done, we should update the antivirus program and rescan the computer again.</p> <h2>Detecting a Computer Error from a Virus Infection</h2> <p>In this section we will treat how to detect a computer or OS fault from a virus because sometimes people and system administrators mix the symptoms.</p> <p>The following events are most likely not caused by a malware &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Error while the system is booting in bios stage, like Bios&rsquo;s battery cell display, timer error display.</li> <li>Hardware errors, like beeps RAM burn, HDD, etc.</li> <li>If a document fails to start normally like a corrupted file, but the other files can be opened accordingly.</li> <li>Keyboard or mouse doesn&rsquo;t answer to your commands, you have to check the plug-ins.</li> <li>Monitor switching on and off too often, like blinking or vibrating, this is a hardware fault.</li> </ul> <p>On the other hand, if you have the following signs in your system, you should check for malware.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Your computer shows a pop-up or error tables.</p> </li> <li> <p>Freezes frequently.</p> </li> <li> <p>It slows down when a program or process starts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Third parties complain that they are receiving invitation in social media or via email by you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Files extensions changes appear or files are added to your system without your consent.</p> </li> <li> <p>Internet Explorer freezes too often even though your internet speed is very good.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your hard disk is accessed most of the time as you can see from the LED light on your computer case.</p> </li> <li> <p>OS files are either corrupted or missing.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your computer is consuming too much bandwidth or network resources this is the case of a computer worm.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hard disk space is occupied all the time, even when you are not taking any action, for example installing a new program.</p> </li> <li> <p>Files and program sizes changes comparing to its original version.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Some Practical Recommendations to Avoid Viruses</strong>&nbsp;&minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Don&rsquo;t open any email attachment coming from unknown people or from known people that contain suspicious text.</li> <li>Don&rsquo;t accept invitation from unknown people on social media.</li> <li>Don&rsquo;t open URL sent by unknown people or known people that are in any weird form.</li> </ul> <h2>Virus Information</h2> <p>If you have found a virus but you want to investigate further regarding its function. I would recommend you to have a look at these virus databases, which are offered generally by antivirus vendors.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Kaspersky Virus Database</strong>&nbsp;&minus; (<a href=\"http://www.kaspersky.com/viruswatchlite?hour_offset=-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kaspersky.com/viruswatchlite?hour_offset=-1</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>F-Secure</strong>&nbsp;&minus; (<a href=\"https://www.f-secure.com/en/web/labs_global/threat-descriptions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.f-secure.com/en/web/labs_global/threat-descriptions</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Symantec &ndash; Virus Encyclopedia</strong>&nbsp;&minus; (<a href=\"https://www.symantec.com/security_response/landing/azlisting.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.symantec.com/security_response/landing/azlisting.jsp</a>)</p> </li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

            "<h2>Encryption</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>In this chapter, we will discuss about the how important Encryption is for Computer Security.</p> <h2>What is Encryption?</h2> <p>Encryption is a transformed type of genuine information where only the authorized parties know how to read it, so in the worst case scenario if somebody has access to these files they would still not be able to understand the message in it.</p> <p>The bases of encryption are since the ancient times. A good example is the pigeon couriers, where the kings used to send messages to their commandants in the battle field in a specific code, when the enemies caught them, they could not read them, just that the message was lost, but if arrived at the destination commandant had the decryption vocabulary so they could decrypt it.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/encryption.jpg\" alt=\"Encryption\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>We should mention that encryption is for good or bad purpose. The bad case is the scenario in which most of the malware files are in an encrypted form, so it cannot be read by everyone accept the hacker.</p> <h2>Tools Used to Encrypt Documents</h2> <p>In this tutorial we will focus more on the practices than on the theoretical aspects for better understanding. Let us discuss about some tools that we use to encrypt documents &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Axcrypt</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is one of the best opensource encryption file softwares. It can be used in Windows OS, Mac OS and Linux as well. This software can be downloaded from &minus;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.axantum.com/AxCrypt/Downloads.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.axantum.com/AxCrypt/Downloads.aspx</a></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>GnuPG</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This is an opensource software again and it can be integrated with other softwares too (like email). It can be downloaded from &minus;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html</a></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Windows BitLocker</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is a Windows integrated tool and its main functions is to secure and encrypt all the hard disk volumes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>FileVault</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is a Mac OS integrated tool and it secures as well as encrypts all the hard disk volume.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Encryption Ways of Communication</h2> <p>System Administrators should use and offer to their staff a secure and encrypted channels of communication and one of them is&nbsp;<strong>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)</strong>.This protocol helps to establish a secure and encrypted connection between the clients and the servers. Generally, it is used for&nbsp;<strong>Web Servers, Mail Servers, FTP servers</strong>.</p> <h3>Why do you need this?</h3> <p>If you have an online shop and your clients are using their credit card and their personal data to purchase products from it. But they (Data) are at the risk to be stolen by a simple wiretapping as the communication is in clear text, to prevent this, SSL Protocol will help to encrypt this communication.</p> <h3>How to see if the communication is secure?</h3> <p>Browsers give visual cues, such as a lock icon or a green bar, to help visitors know when their connection is secured. An example is shown in the following screenshot.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/secure_communication.jpg\" alt=\"Secure Communication\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Another tool used by the system administrator is the&nbsp;<strong>SSH (Secure Shell)</strong>. This is a secure replacement for the telnet and other unencrypted utilities like&nbsp;<strong>rlogin, rcp, rsh</strong>.</p> <p>It provides a secure channel encrypted in the communication host to host over internet. It reduces the man-in-the-middle attacks.

            "<h2>Data Backup</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>In this Chapter, we will discuss backups which is a process of saving data that can be over a network or a computer.</p> <h2>Why is Backup Needed?</h2> <p>The main purpose is to recover the lost data from an unpredictable event like deletion by mistake or file corruption which in many cases is caused by a virus. An example is&nbsp;<strong>Ransomware</strong>, which encrypts all your data when your computer gets infected and the second is to roll back the data at a specific time you want. This is a scenario that happens often in companies which have applications and databases and they want to test their applications with a specific version of data.</p> <h3>How is this Process Managed at Big Companies?</h3> <p>It is suggested that in bigger companies which have a large volume of data, it is necessary to have a backup administrator, which is one of the most trusted persons in the company because he has access to all the data of that organization and generally deals with the backup routine check and the health of the backup.</p> <h2>Backup Devices</h2> <p>In this section we will see the backup devices from smaller to enterprise solutions. For a personal computer, they are &minus;</p> <p><strong>CD and DVD, Blue-Rays&nbsp;</strong>&minus; They are used for home/personal usage where people can store their documents, mainly personal or office related documents because they have small capacities varying from 750MB to 50GB.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/backup_devices.jpg\" alt=\"Backup Devices\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p><strong>Removable Devices</strong>&nbsp;&minus; They are again for home usage (data, documents, music, photos, movies) which can be a Removable USB or external hard disks. Their capacities lately have increased a lot, they vary from 2 GB to 2 TB.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/removable_devices.jpg\" alt=\"Removable Devices\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p><strong>Network attached storage (NAS)</strong>&nbsp;&minus; They are generally devices that are used in small businesses for backup purposes because they offer a centralized manner of backup. All the users can connect through the network to access this device and save data.</p> <p>They are lesser in cost when compared to other solutions and they also offer a good fault tolerance as they are configured in RAID (redundant array of independent disks). They can be rack or non-rack mounted. They offer a good level of authentication of users and web console managing.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/nas.jpg\" alt=\"NAS\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p><strong>Storage Area Network (SAN)</strong>&nbsp;&minus; These are generally devices that are used for big businesses for backup purposes.

One of them in the server is the Windows backup which is included in the Windows Server Edition License.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/backup_based_locations.jpg\" alt=\"Backup based Locations\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Another one is Acronis which is one of the best in the market &minus;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.acronis.com/en-eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.acronis.com/en-eu/</a></p> <h3>Online Backup or Cloud Storage</h3> <p>One of the biggest trend is online storage where the companies and users can store their data somewhere in the cloud, and it is cheaper as well rather than doing it all by yourself. There is also no need for any backup infrastructure and maintenance.</p> <p>For a personal user it is offered for free by the biggest vendors like Microsoft. It offers OneDrive and you can store up to 5GB in their cloud and it has an interface for different Operating Systems.</p> <p>The second is the Google Drive, which is a product by google, wherein the files synchronizes automatically.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/cloud_storage.jpg\" alt=\"Cloud Storage\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>The full list can be seen in PCMagazine &minus;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2413556,00.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2413556,00.asp#</a>.

Such events can be a natural disaster (earthquakes, flood, etc.), cyber&ndash;attack or hardware failure like servers or routers.</p> <p>As such having a document in place it will reduce the down time of business process from the technology and infrastructure side. This document is generally combined with Business Continuity Plan which makes the analyses of all the processes and prioritizes them according to the importance of the businesses. In case of a massive disruption it shows which process should be recovered firstly and what should be the downtime. It also minimizes the application service interruption. It helps us to recover data in the organized process and help the staff to have a clear view about what should be done in case of a disaster.</p> <h2>Requirements to Have a Disaster Recovery Plan</h2> <p>Disaster recovery starts with an inventory of all assets like computers, network equipment, server, etc. and it is recommended to register by serial numbers too. We should make an inventory of all the software and prioritize them according to business importance.</p> <p>An example is shown in the following table &minus;</p> <table class=\"table table-bordered\"> <tbody> <tr> <th>Systems</th> <th>Down Time</th> <th>Disaster type</th> <th>Preventions</th> <th>Solution strategy</th> <th>Recover fully</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Payroll system</td> <td>8 hours</td> <td>Server damaged</td> <td>We take backup daily</td> <td>Restore the backups in the Backup Server</td> <td>Fix the primary server and restore up to date data</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>You should prepare a list of all contacts of your partners and service providers, like ISP contact and data, license that you have purchased and where they are purchased. Documenting all your Network which should include IP schemas, usernames and password of servers.</p> <h3>Preventive steps to be taken for Disaster Recovery</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The server room should have an authorized level. For example: only IT personnel should enter at any given point of time.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the server room there should be a fire alarm, humidity sensor, flood sensor and a temperature sensor.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These are more for prevention.

One primary and one secondary with a device that offers redundancy.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are an enterprise, you should have a disaster recovery site which generally is located out of the city of the main site. The main purpose is to be as a stand-by as in any case of a disaster, it replicates and backs up the data.</p> </li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

We have done the configuration and the system is up and working, but after a week we hear that the platform was hacked.</p> <p>We ask a question to ourselves &ndash; What did we do wrong? We skipped the security of the network which is as important as the set up because this hacking can directly influence the company&rsquo;s reputation resulting in decrease of sales and market value.</p> <h2>Devices that Help us with Network Security</h2> <p><strong>Firewalls</strong>&nbsp;&minus; They can be software or applications which operate at the network level. They protect Private networks from external users and other networks. Generally, they are a compound of programs and their main function is to monitor the traffic flow from outside to inside and vice versa.

For example, you block all incoming traffic to port POP because you don&rsquo;t want to receive a mail so as to be secured from all possible mail attacks. They log all the network attempts for a latter audit for you.</p> <p>They also can work as packet filters this means that the firewall takes the decisions to forward or not the packet based on source and destination addresses and ports.</p> <p>Some of the recommended brands are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Cisco ASA Series</li> <li>Checkpoint</li> <li>Fortinet</li> <li>Juniper</li> <li>SonicWALL</li> <li>pfSense</li> </ul> <h2>Intrusion Detection Systems</h2> <p>Intrusion Detection Systems are also as important as the firewall because they help us to detect the type of attack that is being done to our system and then to make a solution to block them. The monitoring part like tracing logs, looking for doubtful signatures and keeping history of the events triggered. They help also the network administrators to check the connection integrity and authenticity that occur.</p> <p>Let us see the schema of their positions &minus;</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/intrusion_detection_systems.jpg\" alt=\"Intrusion Detection Systems\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Intrusion Detection Tools</h2> <p>One of the best intrusion detection tool is&nbsp;<strong>Snort</strong>, you can take information and download the same from &minus;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.snort.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.snort.org</a></p> <p>It is software based, but is an opensource so it is free and easy to configure. It has a real time signature based network &ndash; IDS, which notifies the system administrators or attacks like port scanners, DDOS attacks, CGI attacks, backdoors, OS finger printing.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/intrusion_detection_tools.jpg\" alt=\"Intrusion Detection Tools\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>The other IDS are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>BlackICE Defender</li> <li>CyberCop Monitor</li> <li>Check point RealSecure</li> <li>Cisco Secure IDS</li> <li>Vanguard Enforcer</li> <li>Lucent RealSecure.</li> </ul> <h2>Virtual Private Network</h2> <p>This type of a network is widely used in a small business or enterprise networks. It helps to send and receive data across the internet, but in a secure and encrypted way. Generally, this network is created between two secure network devices like two firewalls.</p> <p>An example is a connection between two ASA 5505 firewalls as shown in the following image.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_security/images/virtual_private_network.jpg\" alt=\"Virtual Private Network\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

            "<h2>Policies</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>In this chapter we will explain security policies which are the basis of security for the technology infrastructure of your company.</p> <p>In a way they are the regulatory of the behaviors of your employees towards the use of technology in the workplace, that can minimize the risk of being hacked, information leak, internet bad usage and it also ensures safeguarding of company resources.</p> <p>In real life you will notice the employees of your organization will always tend to click on bad or virus infected URL&rsquo;s or email attachments with viruses.</p> <h2>Role of the Security Policy in Setting up Protocols</h2> <p>Following are some pointers which help in setting u protocols for the security policy of an organization.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Who should have access to the system?</li> <li>How it should be configured?</li> <li>How to communicate with third parties or systems?</li> </ul> <p>Policies are divided in two categories &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>User policies</li> <li>IT policies.</li> </ul> <p>User policies generally define the limit of the users towards the computer resources in a workplace. For example, what are they allowed to install in their computer, if they can use removable storages.</p> <p>Whereas, IT policies are designed for IT department, to secure the procedures and functions of IT fields.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>General Policies</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This is the policy which defines the rights of the staff and access level to the systems. Generally, it is included even in the communication protocol as a preventive measure in case there are any disasters.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Server Policies</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This defines who should have access to the specific server and with what rights. Which software&rsquo;s should be installed, level of access to internet, how they should be updated.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Firewall Access and Configuration Policies</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It defines who should have access to the firewall and what type of access, like monitoring, rules change. Which ports and services should be allowed and if it should be inbound or outbound.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Backup Policies</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It defines who is the responsible person for backup, what should be the backup, where it should be backed up, how long it should be kept and the frequency of the backup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>VPN Policies</strong>&nbsp;&minus; These policies generally go with the firewall policy, it defines those users who should have a VPN access and with what rights. For site-to-site connections with partners, it defines the access level of the partner to your network, type of encryption to be set.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Structure of a Security Policy</h2> <p>When you compile a security policy you should have in mind a basic structure in order to make something practical. Some of the main points which have to be taken into consideration are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Description of the Policy and what is the usage for?</li> <li>Where this policy should be applied?</li> <li>Functions and responsibilities of the employees that are affected by this policy.</li> <li>Procedures that are involved in this policy.</li> <li>Consequences if the policy is not compatible with company standards.</li> </ul> <h2>Types of Policies</h2> <p>In this section we will see the most important types of policies.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Permissive Policy</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is a medium restriction policy where we as an administrator block just some well-known ports of malware regarding internet access and just some exploits are taken in consideration.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Prudent Policy</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This is a high restriction policy where everything is blocked regarding the internet access, just a small list of websites are allowed, and now extra services are allowed in computers to be installed and logs are maintained for every user.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Acceptance User Policy</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This policy regulates the behavior of the users towards a system or network or even a webpage, so it is explicitly said what a user can do and cannot in a system. Like are they allowed to share access codes, can they share resources, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>User Account Policy</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This policy defines what a user should do in order to have or maintain another user in a specific system. For example, accessing an e-commerce webpage. To create this policy, you should answer some questions such as &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Should the password be complex or not?</p> </li> <li> <p>What age should the users have?</p> </li> <li> <p>Maximum allowed tries or fails to log in?</p> </li> <li> <p>When the user should be deleted, activated, blocked?</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Information Protection Policy</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This policy is to regulate access to information, hot to process information, how to store and how it should be transferred.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Remote Access Policy</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This policy is mainly for big companies where the user and their branches are outside their headquarters. It tells what should the users access, when they can work and on which software like SSH, VPN, RDP.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Firewall Management Policy</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This policy has explicitly to do with its management, which ports should be blocked, what updates should be taken, how to make changes in the firewall, how long should be the logs be kept.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Special Access Policy</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This policy is intended to keep people under control and monitor the special privileges in their systems and the purpose as to why they have it. These employees can be team leaders, managers, senior managers, system administrators, and such high designation based people.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Network Policy</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This policy is to restrict the access of anyone towards the network resource and make clear who all will access the network. It will also ensure whether that person should be authenticated or not. This policy also includes other aspects like, who will authorize the new devices that will be connected with network? The documentation of network changes. Web filters and the levels of access. Who should have wireless connection and the type of authentication, validity of connection session?</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Email Usage Policy</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This is one of the most important policies that should be done because many users use the work email for personal purposes as well. As a result information can leak outside. Some of the key points of this policy are the employees should know the importance of this system that they have the privilege to use. They should not open any attachments that look suspicious. Private and confidential data should not be sent via any encrypted email.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Software Security Policy</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This policy has to do with the software&rsquo;s installed in the user computer and what they should have. Some of the key points of this policy are Software of the company should not be given to third parties. Only the white list of software&rsquo;s should be allowed, no other software&rsquo;s should be installed in the computer. Warez and pirated software&rsquo;s should not be allowed.</p> </li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

			"<head> <title>Overview</title><h2>DCN - Overview</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>A system of interconnected computers and computerized peripherals such as printers is called computer network. This interconnection among computers facilitates information sharing among them. Computers may connect to each other by either wired or wireless media.</p> <h2>Classification of Computer Networks</h2> <p>Computer networks are classified based on various factors.They includes:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Geographical span</li> <li>Inter-connectivity</li> <li>Administration</li> <li>Architecture</li> </ul> <h2>Geographical Span</h2> <p>Geographically a network can be seen in one of the following categories:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>It may be spanned across your table, among Bluetooth enabled devices,. Ranging not more than few meters.</li> <li>It may be spanned across a whole building, including intermediate devices to connect all floors.</li> <li>It may be spanned across a whole city.</li> <li>It may be spanned across multiple cities or provinces.</li> <li>It may be one network covering whole world.</li> </ul> <h2>Inter-Connectivity</h2> <p>Components of a network can be connected to each other differently in some fashion. By connectedness we mean either logically , physically , or both ways.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Every single device can be connected to every other device on network, making the network mesh.</li> <li>All devices can be connected to a single medium but geographically disconnected, created bus like structure.</li> <li>Each device is connected to its left and right peers only, creating linear structure.</li> <li>All devices connected together with a single device, creating star like structure.</li> <li>All devices connected arbitrarily using all previous ways to connect each other, resulting in a hybrid structure.</li> </ul> <h2>Administration</h2> <p>From an administrator&rsquo;s point of view, a network can be private network which belongs a single autonomous system and cannot be accessed outside its physical or logical domain.A network can be public which is accessed by all.</p> <h2>Network Architecture</h2> <p>Computer networks can be discriminated into various types such as Client-Server,peer-to-peer or hybrid, depending upon its architecture.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>There can be one or more systems acting as Server. Other being Client, requests the Server to serve requests.Server takes and processes request on behalf of Clients.</li> <li>Two systems can be connected Point-to-Point, or in back-to-back fashion. They both reside at the same level and called peers.</li> <li>There can be hybrid network which involves network architecture of both the above types.</li> </ul> <h2>Network Applications</h2> <p>Computer systems and peripherals are connected to form a network.They provide numerous advantages:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Resource sharing such as printers and storage devices</li> <li>Exchange of information by means of e-Mails and FTP</li> <li>Information sharing by using Web or Internet</li> <li>Interaction with other users using dynamic web pages</li> <li>IP phones</li> <li>Video conferences</li> <li>Parallel computing</li> <li>Instant messaging</li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Computer Network Types</title><h2>DCN - Computer Network Types</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Generally, networks are distinguished based on their geographical span. A network can be as small as distance between your mobile phone and its Bluetooth headphone and as large as the internet itself, covering the whole geographical world,</p> <h2>Personal Area Network</h2> <p>A Personal Area Network (PAN) is smallest network which is very personal to a user. This may include Bluetooth enabled devices or infra-red enabled devices. PAN has connectivity range up to 10 meters. PAN may include wireless computer keyboard and mouse, Bluetooth enabled headphones, wireless printers and TV remotes.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/Bluetooth.jpg\" alt=\"Personal Area Network\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>For example, Piconet is Bluetooth-enabled Personal Area Network which may contain up to 8 devices connected together in a master-slave fashion.</p> <h2>Local Area Network</h2> <p>A computer network spanned inside a building and operated under single administrative system is generally termed as Local Area Network (LAN). Usually,LAN covers an organization&rsquo; offices, schools, colleges or universities. Number of systems connected in LAN may vary from as least as two to as much as 16 million.</p> <p>LAN provides a useful way of sharing the resources between end users.The resources such as printers, file servers, scanners, and internet are easily sharable among computers.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/LAN.jpg\" alt=\"Local Area Network\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>LANs are composed of inexpensive networking and routing equipment. It may contains local servers serving file storage and other locally shared applications. It mostly operates on private IP addresses and does not involve heavy routing. LAN works under its own local domain and controlled centrally.</p> <p>LAN uses either Ethernet or Token-ring technology. Ethernet is most widely employed LAN technology and uses Star topology, while Token-ring is rarely seen.</p> <p>LAN can be wired,wireless, or in both forms at once.</p> <h2>Metropolitan Area Network</h2> <p>The Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) generally expands throughout a city such as cable TV network. It can be in the form of Ethernet,Token-ring, ATM, or Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).</p> <p>Metro Ethernet is a service which is provided by ISPs. This service enables its users to expand their Local Area Networks. For example, MAN can help an organization to connect all of its offices in a city.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/MAN.jpg\" alt=\"Metropolitan Area Network\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Backbone of MAN is high-capacity and high-speed fiber optics. MAN works in between Local Area Network and Wide Area Network. MAN provides uplink for LANs to WANs or internet.</p> <h2>Wide Area Network</h2> <p>As the name suggests,the Wide Area Network (WAN) covers a wide area which may span across provinces and even a whole country. Generally, telecommunication networks are Wide Area Network. These networks provide connectivity to MANs and LANs. Since they are equipped with very high speed backbone, WANs use very expensive network equipment.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/WAN.jpg\" alt=\"Wide Area Network\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>WAN may use advanced technologies such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Frame Relay, and Synchronous Optical Network (SONET). WAN may be managed by multiple administration.</p> <h2>Internetwork</h2> <p>A network of networks is called an internetwork, or simply the internet. It is the largest network in existence on this planet.The internet hugely connects all WANs and it can have connection to LANs and Home networks. Internet uses TCP/IP protocol suite and uses IP as its addressing protocol. Present day, Internet is widely implemented using IPv4. Because of shortage of address spaces, it is gradually migrating from IPv4 to IPv6.</p> <p>Internet enables its users to share and access enormous amount of information worldwide. It uses WWW, FTP, email services, audio and video streaming etc. At huge level, internet works on Client-Server model.</p> <p>Internet uses very high speed backbone of fiber optics. To inter-connect various continents, fibers are laid under sea known to us as submarine communication cable.</p> <p>Internet is widely deployed on World Wide Web services using HTML linked pages and is accessible by client software known as Web Browsers. When a user requests a page using some web browser located on some Web Server anywhere in the world, the Web Server responds with the proper HTML page. The communication delay is very low.</p> <p>Internet is serving many proposes and is involved in many aspects of life. Some of them are:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Web sites</li> <li>E-mail</li> <li>Instant Messaging</li> <li>Blogging</li> <li>Social Media</li> <li>Marketing</li> <li>Networking</li> <li>Resource Sharing</li> <li>Audio and Video Streaming</li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Network LAN Technologies</title><h2>DCN - Network LAN Technologies</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Let us go through various LAN technologies in brief:</p> <h2>Ethernet</h2> <p>Ethernet is a widely deployed LAN technology.This technology was invented by Bob Metcalfe and D.R. Boggs in the year 1970. It was standardized in IEEE 802.3 in 1980.</p> <p>Ethernet shares media. Network which uses shared media has high probability of data collision. Ethernet uses Carrier Sense Multi Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) technology to detect collisions. On the occurrence of collision in Ethernet, all its hosts roll back, wait for some random amount of time, and then re-transmit the data.</p> <p>Ethernet connector is,network interface card equipped with 48-bits MAC address. This helps other Ethernet devices to identify and communicate with remote devices in Ethernet.</p> <p>Traditional Ethernet uses 10BASE-T specifications.The number 10 depicts 10MBPS speed, BASE stands for baseband, and T stands for Thick Ethernet. 10BASE-T Ethernet provides transmission speed up to 10MBPS and uses coaxial cable or Cat-5 twisted pair cable with RJ-45 connector. Ethernet follows star topology with segment length up to 100 meters. All devices are connected to a hub/switch in a star fashion.</p> <h2>Fast-Ethernet</h2> <p>To encompass need of fast emerging software and hardware technologies, Ethernet extends itself as Fast-Ethernet. It can run on UTP, Optical Fiber, and wirelessly too. It can provide speed up to 100 MBPS. This standard is named as 100BASE-T in IEEE 803.2 using Cat-5 twisted pair cable. It uses CSMA/CD technique for wired media sharing among the Ethernet hosts and CSMA/CA (CA stands for Collision Avoidance) technique for wireless Ethernet LAN.</p> <p>Fast Ethernet on fiber is defined under 100BASE-FX standard which provides speed up to 100 MBPS on fiber. Ethernet over fiber can be extended up to 100 meters in half-duplex mode and can reach maximum of 2000 meters in full-duplex over multimode fibers.</p> <h2>Giga-Ethernet</h2> <p>After being introduced in 1995, Fast-Ethernet could enjoy its high speed status only for 3 years till Giga-Ethernet introduced. Giga-Ethernet provides speed up to 1000 mbits/seconds. IEEE802.3ab standardize Giga-Ethernet over UTP using Cat-5, Cat-5e and Cat-6 cables. IEEE802.3ah defines Giga-Ethernet over Fiber.</p> <h2>Virtual LAN</h2> <p>LAN uses Ethernet which in turn works on shared media. Shared media in Ethernet create one single Broadcast domain and one single Collision domain. Introduction of switches to Ethernet has removed single collision domain issue and each device connected to switch works in its separate collision domain. But even Switches cannot divide a network into separate Broadcast domains.</p> <p>Virtual LAN is a solution to divide a single Broadcast domain into multiple Broadcast domains. Host in one VLAN cannot speak to a host in another. By default, all hosts are placed into the same VLAN.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/VLAN.jpg\" alt=\"Virtual LAN\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>In this diagram, different VLANs are depicted in different color codes. Hosts in one VLAN, even if connected on the same Switch cannot see or speak to other hosts in different VLANs. VLAN is Layer-2 technology which works closely on Ethernet. To route packets between two different VLANs a Layer-3 device such as Router is required.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Computer Network Toplogies</title><h2>DCN - Computer Network Toplogies</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>A Network Topology is the arrangement with which computer systems or network devices are connected to each other. Topologies may define both physical and logical aspect of the network. Both logical and physical topologies could be same or different in a same network.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Point-to-Point</h2> <p>Point-to-point networks contains exactly two hosts such as computer, switches or routers, servers connected back to back using a single piece of cable. Often, the receiving end of one host is connected to sending end of the other and vice-versa.</p> <figure><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/p2p_topology.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></figure> <p>If the hosts are connected point-to-point logically, then may have multiple intermediate devices. But the end hosts are unaware of underlying network and see each other as if they are connected directly.</p> <h2>Bus Topology</h2> <p>In case of Bus topology, all devices share single communication line or cable.Bus topology may have problem while multiple hosts sending data at the same time. Therefore, Bus topology either uses CSMA/CD technology or recognizes one host as Bus Master to solve the issue. It is one of the simple forms of networking where a failure of a device does not affect the other devices. But failure of the shared communication line can make all other devices stop functioning.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/bus_topology.jpg\" alt=\"Bus Topology\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Both ends of the shared channel have line terminator. The data is sent in only one direction and as soon as it reaches the extreme end, the terminator removes the data from the line.</p> <h2>Star Topology</h2> <p>All hosts in Star topology are connected to a central device, known as hub device, using a point-to-point connection. That is, there exists a point to point connection between hosts and hub. The hub device can be any of the following:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Layer-1 device such as hub or repeater</li> <li>Layer-2 device such as switch or bridge</li> <li>Layer-3 device such as router or gateway</li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/star_topology.jpg\" alt=\"Star Topology\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>As in Bus topology, hub acts as single point of failure. If hub fails, connectivity of all hosts to all other hosts fails. Every communication between hosts, takes place through only the hub.Star topology is not expensive as to connect one more host, only one cable is required and configuration is simple.</p> <h2>Ring Topology</h2> <p>In ring topology, each host machine connects to exactly two other machines, creating a circular network structure. When one host tries to communicate or send message to a host which is not adjacent to it, the data travels through all intermediate hosts. To connect one more host in the existing structure, the administrator may need only one more extra cable.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/ring_topology.jpg\" alt=\"Ring Topology\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Failure of any host results in failure of the whole ring.Thus, every connection in the ring is a point of failure. There are methods which employ one more backup ring.</p> <h2>Mesh Topology</h2> <p>In this type of topology, a host is connected to one or multiple hosts.This topology has hosts in point-to-point connection with every other host or may also have hosts which are in point-to-point connection to few hosts only.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/mesh_topology.jpg\" alt=\"Full Mesh Topology\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Hosts in Mesh topology also work as relay for other hosts which do not have direct point-to-point links. Mesh technology comes into two types:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li><strong>Full Mesh</strong>: All hosts have a point-to-point connection to every other host in the network. Thus for every new host n(n-1)/2 connections are required. It provides the most reliable network structure among all network topologies.</li> <li><strong>Partially Mesh</strong>: Not all hosts have point-to-point connection to every other host. Hosts connect to each other in some arbitrarily fashion. This topology exists where we need to provide reliability to some hosts out of all.</li> </ul> <h2>Tree Topology</h2> <p>Also known as Hierarchical Topology, this is the most common form of network topology in use presently.This topology imitates as extended Star topology and inherits properties of bus topology.</p> <p>This topology divides the network in to multiple levels/layers of network. Mainly in LANs, a network is bifurcated into three types of network devices. The lowermost is access-layer where computers are attached. The middle layer is known as distribution layer, which works as mediator between upper layer and lower layer. The highest layer is known as core layer, and is central point of the network, i.e. root of the tree from which all nodes fork.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/tree_topology.jpg\" alt=\"Tree Topology\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>All neighboring hosts have point-to-point connection between them.Similar to the Bus topology, if the root goes down, then the entire network suffers even.though it is not the single point of failure. Every connection serves as point of failure, failing of which divides the network into unreachable segment.</p> <h2>Daisy Chain</h2> <p>This topology connects all the hosts in a linear fashion. Similar to Ring topology, all hosts are connected to two hosts only, except the end hosts.Means, if the end hosts in daisy chain are connected then it represents Ring topology.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/daisy_chain_topology.jpg\" alt=\"Daisy Chain Topology\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Each link in daisy chain topology represents single point of failure. Every link failure splits the network into two segments.Every intermediate host works as relay for its immediate hosts.</p> <h2>Hybrid Topology</h2> <p>A network structure whose design contains more than one topology is said to be hybrid topology. Hybrid topology inherits merits and demerits of all the incorporating topologies.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/hybrid_topology.jpg\" alt=\"Hybrid Topology\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>The above picture represents an arbitrarily hybrid topology. The combining topologies may contain attributes of Star, Ring, Bus, and Daisy-chain topologies. Most WANs are connected by means of Dual-Ring topology and networks connected to them are mostly Star topology networks. Internet is the best example of largest Hybrid topology</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Computer Network Models</title><h2>DCN - Computer Network Models</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Networking engineering is a complicated task, which involves software, firmware, chip level engineering, hardware, and electric pulses. To ease network engineering, the whole networking concept is divided into multiple layers. Each layer is involved in some particular task and is independent of all other layers. But as a whole, almost all networking tasks depend on all of these layers. Layers share data between them and they depend on each other only to take input and send output.</p> <h2>Layered Tasks</h2> <p>In layered architecture of Network Model, one whole network process is divided into small tasks. Each small task is then assigned to a particular layer which works dedicatedly to process the task only. Every layer does only specific work.</p> <p>In layered communication system, one layer of a host deals with the task done by or to be done by its peer layer at the same level on the remote host. The task is either initiated by layer at the lowest level or at the top most level. If the task is initiated by the-top most layer, it is passed on to the layer below it for further processing. The lower layer does the same thing, it processes the task and passes on to lower layer. If the task is initiated by lower most layer, then the reverse path is taken.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/layered_tasks.jpg\" alt=\"Layered Tasks\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Every layer clubs together all procedures, protocols, and methods which it requires to execute its piece of task. All layers identify their counterparts by means of encapsulation header and tail.</p> <h2>OSI Model</h2> <p>Open System Interconnect is an open standard for all communication systems. OSI model is established by International Standard Organization (ISO). This model has seven layers:</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/OSI_model.jpg\" alt=\"OSI Model\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Application Layer</strong>: This layer is responsible for providing interface to the application user. This layer encompasses protocols which directly interact with the user.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Presentation Layer</strong>: This layer defines how data in the native format of remote host should be presented in the native format of host.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Session Layer</strong>: This layer maintains sessions between remote hosts. For example, once user/password authentication is done, the remote host maintains this session for a while and does not ask for authentication again in that time span.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Transport Layer</strong>: This layer is responsible for end-to-end delivery between hosts.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Network Layer</strong>: This layer is responsible for address assignment and uniquely addressing hosts in a network.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Data Link Layer</strong>: This layer is responsible for reading and writing data from and onto the line. Link errors are detected at this layer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Physical Layer</strong>: This layer defines the hardware, cabling wiring, power output, pulse rate etc.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Internet Model</h2> <p>Internet uses TCP/IP protocol suite, also known as Internet suite. This defines Internet Model which contains four layered architecture. OSI Model is general communication model but Internet Model is what the internet uses for all its communication.The internet is independent of its underlying network architecture so is its Model. This model has the following layers:</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/Internet_model.jpg\" alt=\"Internet Model\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Application Layer</strong>: This layer defines the protocol which enables user to interact with the network.For example, FTP, HTTP etc.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Transport Layer</strong>: This layer defines how data should flow between hosts. Major protocol at this layer is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). This layer ensures data delivered between hosts is in-order and is responsible for end-to-end delivery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Internet Layer</strong>: Internet Protocol (IP) works on this layer. This layer facilitates host addressing and recognition. This layer defines routing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Link Layer</strong>: This layer provides mechanism of sending and receiving actual data.Unlike its OSI Model counterpart, this layer is independent of underlying network architecture and hardware.</p> </li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Computer Network Security</title><h2>DCN - Computer Network Security</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>During initial days of internet, its use was limited to military and universities for research and development purpose. Later when all networks merged together and formed internet, the data useds to travel through public transit network.Common people may send the data that can be highly sensitive such as their bank credentials, username and passwords, personal documents, online shopping details, or confidential documents.</p> <p>All security threats are intentional i.e. they occur only if intentionally triggered. Security threats can be divided into the following categories:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Interruption</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Interruption is a security threat in which availability of resources is attacked. For example, a user is unable to access its web-server or the web-server is hijacked.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Privacy-Breach</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In this threat, the privacy of a user is compromised. Someone, who is not the authorized person is accessing or intercepting data sent or received by the original authenticated user.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Integrity</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This type of threat includes any alteration or modification in the original context of communication. The attacker intercepts and receives the data sent by the sender and the attacker then either modifies or generates false data and sends to the receiver. The receiver receives the data assuming that it is being sent by the original Sender.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Authenticity</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This threat occurs when an attacker or a security violator, poses as a genuine person and accesses the resources or communicates with other genuine users.</p> </li> </ul> <p>No technique in the present world can provide 100% security. But steps can be taken to secure data while it travels in unsecured network or internet. The most widely used technique is Cryptography.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/cryptography.jpg\" alt=\"Cryptography\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Cryptography is a technique to encrypt the plain-text data which makes it difficult to understand and interpret. There are several cryptographic algorithms available present day as described below:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Secret Key</p> </li> <li> <p>Public Key</p> </li> <li> <p>Message Digest</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Secret Key Encryption</h2> <p>Both sender and receiver have one secret key. This secret key is used to encrypt the data at sender&rsquo;s end. After the data is encrypted, it is sent on the public domain to the receiver. Because the receiver knows and has the Secret Key, the encrypted data packets can easily be decrypted.</p> <p>Example of secret key encryption is Data Encryption Standard (DES). In Secret Key encryption, it is required to have a separate key for each host on the network making it difficult to manage.</p> <h2>Public Key Encryption</h2> <p>In this encryption system, every user has its own Secret Key and it is not in the shared domain. The secret key is never revealed on public domain. Along with secret key, every user has its own but public key. Public key is always made public and is used by Senders to encrypt the data. When the user receives the encrypted data, he can easily decrypt it by using its own Secret Key.</p> <p>Example of public key encryption is Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA).</p> <h2>Message Digest</h2> <p>In this method, actual data is not sent, instead a hash value is calculated and sent. The other end user, computes its own hash value and compares with the one just received.If both hash values are matched, then it is accepted otherwise rejected.</p> <p>Example of Message Digest is MD5 hashing. It is mostly used in authentication where user password is cross checked with the one saved on the server.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

			"<head> <title>Physical Layer Introduction</title><h2>Physical Layer Introduction</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Physical layer in the OSI model plays the role of interacting with actual hardware and signaling mechanism. Physical layer is the only layer of OSI network model which actually deals with the physical connectivity of two different stations. This layer defines the hardware equipment, cabling, wiring, frequencies, pulses used to represent binary signals etc.</p> <p>Physical layer provides its services to Data-link layer. Data-link layer hands over frames to physical layer. Physical layer converts them to electrical pulses, which represent binary data.The binary data is then sent over the wired or wireless media.</p> <h2>Signals</h2> <p>When data is sent over physical medium, it needs to be first converted into electromagnetic signals. Data itself can be analog such as human voice, or digital such as file on the disk.Both analog and digital data can be represented in digital or analog signals.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Digital Signals</strong></p> <p>Digital signals are discrete in nature and represent sequence of voltage pulses. Digital signals are used within the circuitry of a computer system.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Analog Signals</strong></p> <p>Analog signals are in continuous wave form in nature and represented by continuous electromagnetic waves.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Transmission Impairment</h2> <p>When signals travel through the medium they tend to deteriorate. This may have many reasons as given:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Attenuation</strong></p> <p>For the receiver to interpret the data accurately, the signal must be sufficiently strong.When the signal passes through the medium, it tends to get weaker.As it covers distance, it loses strength.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dispersion</strong></p> <p>As signal travels through the media, it tends to spread and overlaps. The amount of dispersion depends upon the frequency used.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Delay distortion</strong></p> <p>Signals are sent over media with pre-defined speed and frequency. If the signal speed and frequency do not match, there are possibilities that signal reaches destination in arbitrary fashion. In digital media, this is very critical that some bits reach earlier than the previously sent ones.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Noise</strong></p> <p>Random disturbance or fluctuation in analog or digital signal is said to be Noise in signal, which may distort the actual information being carried. Noise can be characterized in one of the following class:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Thermal Noise</strong></p> <p>Heat agitates the electronic conductors of a medium which may introduce noise in the media. Up to a certain level, thermal noise is unavoidable.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Intermodulation</strong></p> <p>When multiple frequencies share a medium, their interference can cause noise in the medium. Intermodulation noise occurs if two different frequencies are sharing a medium and one of them has excessive strength or the component itself is not functioning properly, then the resultant frequency may not be delivered as expected.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Crosstalk</strong></p> <p>This sort of noise happens when a foreign signal enters into the media. This is because signal in one medium affects the signal of second medium.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Impulse</strong></p> <p>This noise is introduced because of irregular disturbances such as lightening, electricity, short-circuit, or faulty components. Digital data is mostly affected by this sort of noise.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Transmission Media</h2> <p>The media over which the information between two computer systems is sent, called transmission media. Transmission media comes in two forms.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Guided Media</strong></p> <p>All communication wires/cables are guided media, such as UTP, coaxial cables, and fiber Optics. In this media, the sender and receiver are directly connected and the information is send (guided) through it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Unguided Media</strong></p> <p>Wireless or open air space is said to be unguided media, because there is no connectivity between the sender and receiver. Information is spread over the air, and anyone including the actual recipient may collect the information.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Channel Capacity</h2> <p>The speed of transmission of information is said to be the channel capacity. We count it as data rate in digital world. It depends on numerous factors such as:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Bandwidth:</strong>&nbsp; The physical limitation of underlying media.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Error-rate:</strong>&nbsp; Incorrect reception of information because of noise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encoding:</strong>&nbsp; The number of levels used for signaling.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Multiplexing</h2> <p>Multiplexing is a technique to mix and send multiple data streams over a single medium. This technique requires system hardware called multiplexer (MUX) for multiplexing the streams and sending them on a medium, and de-multiplexer (DMUX) which takes information from the medium and distributes to different destinations.</p> <h2>Switching</h2> <p>Switching is a mechanism by which data/information sent from source towards destination which are not directly connected. Networks have interconnecting devices, which receives data from directly connected sources, stores data, analyze it and then forwards to the next interconnecting device closest to the destination.</p> <p>Switching can be categorized as:</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/switching.jpg\" alt=\"Switching\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Digital Transmission</title><h2>Digital Transmission</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Data or information can be stored in two ways, analog and digital. For a computer to use the data, it must be in discrete digital form.Similar to data, signals can also be in analog and digital form. To transmit data digitally, it needs to be first converted to digital form.</p> <h2>Digital-to-Digital Conversion</h2> <p>This section explains how to convert digital data into digital signals. It can be done in two ways, line coding and block coding. For all communications, line coding is necessary whereas block coding is optional.</p> <h2>Line Coding</h2> <p>The process for converting digital data into digital signal is said to be Line Coding. Digital data is found in binary format.It is represented (stored) internally as series of 1s and 0s.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/line_coding.jpg\" alt=\"Line Coding\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Digital signal is denoted by discreet signal, which represents digital data.There are three types of line coding schemes available:</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/line_coding_schemes.jpg\" alt=\"Line Coding\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h3>Uni-polar Encoding</h3> <p>Unipolar encoding schemes use single voltage level to represent data. In this case, to represent binary 1, high voltage is transmitted and to represent 0, no voltage is transmitted. It is also called Unipolar-Non-return-to-zero, because there is no rest condition i.e. it either represents 1 or 0.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/Unipolar_NRZ.jpg\" alt=\"UniPolar NRZ Encoding\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h3>Polar Encoding</h3> <p>Polar encoding scheme uses multiple voltage levels to represent binary values. Polar encodings is available in four types:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Polar Non-Return to Zero (Polar NRZ)</p> <p>It uses two different voltage levels to represent binary values. Generally, positive voltage represents 1 and negative value represents 0. It is also NRZ because there is no rest condition.</p> <p>NRZ scheme has two variants: NRZ-L and NRZ-I.</p> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/Polar_NRZ.jpg\" alt=\"Unipolar NRZ\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>NRZ-L changes voltage level at when a different bit is encountered whereas NRZ-I changes voltage when a 1 is encountered.</p> </li> <li> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Return to Zero (RZ)</h3> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Problem with NRZ is that the receiver cannot conclude when a bit ended and when the next bit is started, in case when sender and receiver&rsquo;s clock are not synchronized.</p> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/RZ.jpg\" alt=\"Return-to-Zero\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>RZ uses three voltage levels, positive voltage to represent 1, negative voltage to represent 0 and zero voltage for none. Signals change during bits not between bits.</p> </li> <li> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Manchester</h3> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This encoding scheme is a combination of RZ and NRZ-L. Bit time is divided into two halves. It transits in the middle of the bit and changes phase when a different bit is encountered.</p> </li> <li> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Differential Manchester</h3> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This encoding scheme is a combination of RZ and NRZ-I. It also transit at the middle of the bit but changes phase only when 1 is encountered.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Bipolar Encoding</h3> <p>Bipolar encoding uses three voltage levels, positive, negative and zero. Zero voltage represents binary 0 and bit 1 is represented by altering positive and negative voltages.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/bipolar.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Block Coding</h2> <p>To ensure accuracy of the received data frame redundant bits are used. For example, in even-parity, one parity bit is added to make the count of 1s in the frame even. This way the original number of bits is increased. It is called Block Coding.</p> <p>Block coding is represented by slash notation, mB/nB.Means, m-bit block is substituted with n-bit block where n &gt; m. Block coding involves three steps:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Division,</li> <li>Substitution</li> <li>Combination.</li> </ul> <p>After block coding is done, it is line coded for transmission.</p> <h2>Analog-to-Digital Conversion</h2> <p>Microphones create analog voice and camera creates analog videos, which are treated is analog data. To transmit this analog data over digital signals, we need analog to digital conversion.</p> <p>Analog data is a continuous stream of data in the wave form whereas digital data is discrete. To convert analog wave into digital data, we use Pulse Code Modulation (PCM).</p> <p>PCM is one of the most commonly used method to convert analog data into digital form. It involves three steps:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Sampling</li> <li>Quantization</li> <li>Encoding.</li> </ul> <h3>Sampling</h3> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/sampling.jpg\" alt=\"Sampling\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>The analog signal is sampled every T interval. Most important factor in sampling is the rate at which analog signal is sampled. According to Nyquist Theorem, the sampling rate must be at least two times of the highest frequency of the signal.</p> <h3>Quantization</h3> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/quantization.jpg\" alt=\"Quantization\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Sampling yields discrete form of continuous analog signal. Every discrete pattern shows the amplitude of the analog signal at that instance. The quantization is done between the maximum amplitude value and the minimum amplitude value. Quantization is approximation of the instantaneous analog value.</p> <h3>Encoding</h3> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/encoding.jpg\" alt=\"Encoding\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>In encoding, each approximated value is then converted into binary format.</p> <h2>Transmission Modes</h2> <p>The transmission mode decides how data is transmitted between two computers.The binary data in the form of 1s and 0s can be sent in two different modes: Parallel and Serial.</p> <h3>Parallel Transmission</h3> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/parallel.jpg\" alt=\"Parallel Transmission\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>The binary bits are organized in-to groups of fixed length. Both sender and receiver are connected in parallel with the equal number of data lines. Both computers distinguish between high order and low order data lines. The sender sends all the bits at once on all lines.Because the data lines are equal to the number of bits in a group or data frame, a complete group of bits (data frame) is sent in one go. Advantage of Parallel transmission is high speed and disadvantage is the cost of wires, as it is equal to the number of bits sent in parallel.</p> <h3>Serial Transmission</h3> <p>In serial transmission, bits are sent one after another in a queue manner. Serial transmission requires only one communication channel.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/serial.jpg\" alt=\"Serial Transmission\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Serial transmission can be either asynchronous or synchronous.</p> <h3>Asynchronous Serial Transmission</h3> <p>It is named so because there&rsquo;is no importance of timing. Data-bits have specific pattern and they help receiver recognize the start and end data bits.For example, a 0 is prefixed on every data byte and one or more 1s are added at the end.</p> <p>Two continuous data-frames (bytes) may have a gap between them.</p> <h3>Synchronous Serial Transmission</h3> <p>Timing in synchronous transmission has importance as there is no mechanism followed to recognize start and end data bits.There is no pattern or prefix/suffix method. Data bits are sent in burst mode without maintaining gap between bytes (8-bits). Single burst of data bits may contain a number of bytes. Therefore, timing becomes very important.</p> <p>It is up to the receiver to recognize and separate bits into bytes.The advantage of synchronous transmission is high speed, and it has no overhead of extra header and footer bits as in asynchronous transmission.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Analog Transmission</title><h2>Analog Transmission</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>To send the digital data over an analog media, it needs to be converted into analog signal.There can be two cases according to data formatting.</p> <p><strong>Bandpass:</strong>The filters are used to filter and pass frequencies of interest. A bandpass is a band of frequencies which can pass the filter.</p> <p><strong>Low-pass:</strong>&nbsp;Low-pass is a filter that passes low frequencies signals.</p> <p>When digital data is converted into a bandpass analog signal, it is called digital-to-analog conversion. When low-pass analog signal is converted into bandpass analog signal, it is called analog-to-analog conversion.</p> <h2>Digital-to-Analog Conversion</h2> <p>When data from one computer is sent to another via some analog carrier, it is first converted into analog signals. Analog signals are modified to reflect digital data.</p> <p>An analog signal is characterized by its amplitude, frequency, and phase. There are three kinds of digital-to-analog conversions:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Amplitude Shift Keying</strong></p> <p>In this conversion technique, the amplitude of analog carrier signal is modified to reflect binary data.</p> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/amplitude_shift_keying.jpg\" alt=\"Amplitude Shift Keying\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>When binary data represents digit 1, the amplitude is held; otherwise it is set to 0. Both frequency and phase remain same as in the original carrier signal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Frequency Shift Keying</strong></p> <p>In this conversion technique, the frequency of the analog carrier signal is modified to reflect binary data.</p> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/frequency_shift_keying.jpg\" alt=\"Frequency Shift Keying\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>This technique uses two frequencies, f1 and f2. One of them, for example f1, is chosen to represent binary digit 1 and the other one is used to represent binary digit 0. Both amplitude and phase of the carrier wave are kept intact.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Phase Shift Keying</strong></p> <p>In this conversion scheme, the phase of the original carrier signal is altered to reflect the binary data.</p> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/phase_shift_keying.jpg\" alt=\"Phase Shift Keying\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>When a new binary symbol is encountered, the phase of the signal is altered. Amplitude and frequency of the original carrier signal is kept intact.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Quadrature Phase Shift Keying</strong></p> <p>QPSK alters the phase to reflect two binary digits at once. This is done in two different phases. The main stream of binary data is divided equally into two sub-streams. The serial data is converted in to parallel in both sub-streams and then each stream is converted to digital signal using NRZ technique. Later, both the digital signals are merged together.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Analog-to-Analog Conversion</h2> <p>Analog signals are modified to represent analog data. This conversion is also known as Analog Modulation. Analog modulation is required when bandpass is used. Analog to analog conversion can be done in three ways:</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/analog_modulation.jpg\" alt=\"Analog Modulation\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Amplitude Modulation</strong></p> <p>In this modulation, the amplitude of the carrier signal is modified to reflect the analog data.</p> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/amplitude_modulation.jpg\" alt=\"Amplitude Modulation\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>Amplitude modulation is implemented by means of a multiplier. The amplitude of modulating signal (analog data) is multiplied by the amplitude of carrier frequency, which then reflects analog data.</p> <p>The frequency and phase of carrier signal remain unchanged.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Frequency Modulation</strong></p> <p>In this modulation technique, the frequency of the carrier signal is modified to reflect the change in the voltage levels of the modulating signal (analog data).</p> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/frequency_modulation.jpg\" alt=\"Frequency Modulation\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>The amplitude and phase of the carrier signal are not altered.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Phase Modulation</strong></p> <p>In the modulation technique, the phase of carrier signal is modulated in order to reflect the change in voltage (amplitude) of analog data signal.</p> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/phase_modulation.jpg\" alt=\"Phase Modulation\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>Phase modulation is practically similar to Frequency Modulation, but in Phase modulation frequency of the carrier signal is not increased. Frequency of carrier is signal is changed (made dense and sparse) to reflect voltage change in the amplitude of modulating signal.</p> </li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Transmission Media</title><h2>Transmission Media</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>The transmission media is nothing but the physical media over which communication takes place in computer networks.</p> <h2>Magnetic Media</h2> <p>One of the most convenient way to transfer data from one computer to another, even before the birth of networking, was to save it on some storage media and transfer physical from one station to another. Though it may seem old-fashion way in today&rsquo;s world of high speed internet, but when the size of data is huge, the magnetic media comes into play.</p> <p>For example, a bank has to handle and transfer huge data of its customer, which stores a backup of it at some geographically far-away place for security reasons and to keep it from uncertain calamities. If the bank needs to store its huge backup data then its,transfer through internet is not feasible.The WAN links may not support such high speed.Even if they do; the cost too high to afford.</p> <p>In these cases, data backup is stored onto magnetic tapes or magnetic discs, and then shifted physically at remote places.</p> <h2>Twisted Pair Cable</h2> <p>A twisted pair cable is made of two plastic insulated copper wires twisted together to form a single media. Out of these two wires, only one carries actual signal and another is used for ground reference. The twists between wires are helpful in reducing noise (electro-magnetic interference) and crosstalk.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images//twisted_pairs.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>There are two types of twisted pair cables:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) Cable</p> </li> <li> <p>Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) Cable</p> </li> </ul> <p>STP cables comes with twisted wire pair covered in metal foil. This makes it more indifferent to noise and crosstalk.</p> <p>UTP has seven categories, each suitable for specific use. In computer networks, Cat-5, Cat-5e, and Cat-6 cables are mostly used. UTP cables are connected by RJ45 connectors.</p> <h2>Coaxial Cable</h2> <p>Coaxial cable has two wires of copper. The core wire lies in the center and it is made of solid conductor.The core is enclosed in an insulating sheath.The second wire is wrapped around over the sheath and that too in turn encased by insulator sheath.This all is covered by plastic cover.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images//coaxial_cable.jpg\" alt=\"Coaxial Cable\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Because of its structure,the coax cable is capable of carrying high frequency signals than that of twisted pair cable.The wrapped structure provides it a good shield against noise and cross talk. Coaxial cables provide high bandwidth rates of up to 450 mbps.</p> <p>There are three categories of coax cables namely, RG-59 (Cable TV), RG-58 (Thin Ethernet), and RG-11 (Thick Ethernet). RG stands for Radio Government.</p> <p>Cables are connected using BNC connector and BNC-T. BNC terminator is used to terminate the wire at the far ends.</p> <h2>Power Lines</h2> <p>Power Line communication (PLC) is Layer-1 (Physical Layer) technology which uses power cables to transmit data signals.In PLC, modulated data is sent over the cables. The receiver on the other end de-modulates and interprets the data.</p> <p>Because power lines are widely deployed, PLC can make all powered devices controlled and monitored. PLC works in half-duplex.</p> <p>There are two types of PLC:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Narrow band PLC</p> </li> <li> <p>Broad band PLC</p> </li> </ul> <p>Narrow band PLC provides lower data rates up to 100s of kbps, as they work at lower frequencies (3-5000 kHz).They can be spread over several kilometers.</p> <p>Broadband PLC provides higher data rates up to 100s of Mbps and works at higher frequencies (1.8 &ndash; 250 MHz).They cannot be as much extended as Narrowband PLC.</p> <h2>Fiber Optics</h2> <p>Fiber Optic works on the properties of light. When light ray hits at critical angle it tends to refracts at 90 degree. This property has been used in fiber optic. The core of fiber optic cable is made of high quality glass or plastic. From one end of it light is emitted, it travels through it and at the other end light detector detects light stream and converts it to electric data.</p> <p>Fiber Optic provides the highest mode of speed. It comes in two modes, one is single mode fiber and second is multimode fiber. Single mode fiber can carry a single ray of light whereas multimode is capable of carrying multiple beams of light.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images//fiber_optics.jpg\" alt=\"Fiber Optics\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Fiber Optic also comes in unidirectional and bidirectional capabilities. To connect and access fiber optic special type of connectors are used. These can be Subscriber Channel (SC), Straight Tip (ST), or MT-RJ.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Wireless Transmission</title><h2>Wireless Transmission</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Wireless transmission is a form of unguided media. Wireless communication involves no physical link established between two or more devices, communicating wirelessly. Wireless signals are spread over in the air and are received and interpreted by appropriate antennas.</p> <p>When an antenna is attached to electrical circuit of a computer or wireless device, it converts the digital data into wireless signals and spread all over within its frequency range. The receptor on the other end receives these signals and converts them back to digital data.</p> <p>A little part of electromagnetic spectrum can be used for wireless transmission.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/electromagnetic_spectrum.jpg\" alt=\"Electromagnetic Spectrum\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Radio Transmission</h2> <p>Radio frequency is easier to generate and because of its large wavelength it can penetrate through walls and structures alike.Radio waves can have wavelength from 1 mm &ndash; 100,000 km and have frequency ranging from 3 Hz (Extremely Low Frequency) to 300 GHz (Extremely High Frequency). Radio frequencies are sub-divided into six bands.</p> <p>Radio waves at lower frequencies can travel through walls whereas higher RF can travel in straight line and bounce back.The power of low frequency waves decreases sharply as they cover long distance. High frequency radio waves have more power.</p> <p>Lower frequencies such as VLF, LF, MF bands can travel on the ground up to 1000 kilometers, over the earth&rsquo;s surface.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/radio_wave_grounded.jpg\" alt=\"Radio wave - grounded\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Radio waves of high frequencies are prone to be absorbed by rain and other obstacles. They use Ionosphere of earth atmosphere. High frequency radio waves such as HF and VHF bands are spread upwards. When they reach Ionosphere, they are refracted back to the earth.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/radio_wave_ionosphere.jpg\" alt=\"Radio wave - Ionosphere\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Microwave Transmission</h2> <p>Electromagnetic waves above 100 MHz tend to travel in a straight line and signals over them can be sent by beaming those waves towards one particular station. Because Microwaves travels in straight lines, both sender and receiver must be aligned to be strictly in line-of-sight.</p> <p>Microwaves can have wavelength ranging from 1 mm &ndash; 1 meter and frequency ranging from 300 MHz to 300 GHz.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/microwave.jpg\" alt=\"Personal Area Network\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Microwave antennas concentrate the waves making a beam of it. As shown in picture above, multiple antennas can be aligned to reach farther. Microwaves have higher frequencies and do not penetrate wall like obstacles.</p> <p>Microwave transmission depends highly upon the weather conditions and the frequency it is using.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Infrared Transmission</h2> <p>Infrared wave lies in between visible light spectrum and microwaves. It has wavelength of 700-nm to 1-mm and frequency ranges from 300-GHz to 430-THz.</p> <p>Infrared wave is used for very short range communication purposes such as television and it&rsquo;s remote. Infrared travels in a straight line hence it is directional by nature. Because of high frequency range, Infrared cannot cross wall-like obstacles.</p> <h2>Light Transmission</h2> <p>Highest most electromagnetic spectrum which can be used for data transmission is light or optical signaling. This is achieved by means of LASER.</p> <p>Because of frequency light uses, it tends to travel strictly in straight line.Hence the sender and receiver must be in the line-of-sight. Because laser transmission is unidirectional, at both ends of communication the laser and the photo-detector needs to be installed. Laser beam is generally 1mm wide hence it is a work of precision to align two far receptors each pointing to lasers source.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/light_transmission.jpg\" alt=\"Light Transmission\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Laser works as Tx (transmitter) and photo-detectors works as Rx (receiver).</p> <p>Lasers cannot penetrate obstacles such as walls, rain, and thick fog. Additionally, laser beam is distorted by wind, atmosphere temperature, or variation in temperature in the path.</p> <p>Laser is safe for data transmission as it is very difficult to tap 1mm wide laser without interrupting the communication channel.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Multiplexing</title><h2>Multiplexing</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Multiplexing is a technique by which different analog and digital streams of transmission can be simultaneously processed over a shared link. Multiplexing divides the high capacity medium into low capacity logical medium which is then shared by different streams.</p> <p>Communication is possible over the air (radio frequency), using a physical media (cable), and light (optical fiber). All mediums are capable of multiplexing.</p> <p>When multiple senders try to send over a single medium, a device called Multiplexer divides the physical channel and allocates one to each. On the other end of communication, a De-multiplexer receives data from a single medium, identifies each, and sends to different receivers.</p> <h2>Frequency Division Multiplexing</h2> <p>When the carrier is frequency, FDM is used. FDM is an analog technology. FDM divides the spectrum or carrier bandwidth in logical channels and allocates one user to each channel. Each user can use the channel frequency independently and has exclusive access of it. All channels are divided in such a way that they do not overlap with each other. Channels are separated by guard bands. Guard band is a frequency which is not used by either channel.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/fdm.jpg\" alt=\"Frequency Division Multiplexing\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Time Division Multiplexing</h2> <p>TDM is applied primarily on digital signals but can be applied on analog signals as well. In TDM the shared channel is divided among its user by means of time slot. Each user can transmit data within the provided time slot only. Digital signals are divided in frames, equivalent to time slot i.e. frame of an optimal size which can be transmitted in given time slot.</p> <p>TDM works in synchronized mode. Both ends, i.e. Multiplexer and De-multiplexer are timely synchronized and both switch to next channel simultaneously.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/tdm.jpg\" alt=\"Time Division Multiplexing\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>When channel A transmits its frame at one end,the De-multiplexer provides media to channel A on the other end.As soon as the channel A&rsquo;s time slot expires, this side switches to channel B. On the other end, the De-multiplexer works in a synchronized manner and provides media to channel B. Signals from different channels travel the path in interleaved manner.</p> <h2>Wavelength Division Multiplexing</h2> <p>Light has different wavelength (colors). In fiber optic mode, multiple optical carrier signals are multiplexed into an optical fiber by using different wavelengths. This is an analog multiplexing technique and is done conceptually in the same manner as FDM but uses light as signals.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/wdm.jpg\" alt=\"Wavelength Division Multiplexing\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Further, on each wavelength time division multiplexing can be incorporated to accommodate more data signals.</p> <h2>Code Division Multiplexing</h2> <p>Multiple data signals can be transmitted over a single frequency by using Code Division Multiplexing. FDM divides the frequency in smaller channels but CDM allows its users to full bandwidth and transmit signals all the time using a unique code. CDM uses orthogonal codes to spread signals.</p> <p>Each station is assigned with a unique code, called chip. Signals travel with these codes independently, inside the whole bandwidth.The receiver knows in advance the chip code signal it has to receive.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Network Switching</title><h2>Network Switching</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Switching is process to forward packets coming in from one port to a port leading towards the destination. When data comes on a port it is called ingress, and when data leaves a port or goes out it is called egress. A communication system may include number of switches and nodes. At broad level, switching can be divided into two major categories:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Connectionless:</strong>&nbsp;The data is forwarded on behalf of forwarding tables. No previous handshaking is required and acknowledgements are optional.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Connection Oriented:</strong>&nbsp; Before switching data to be forwarded to destination, there is a need to pre-establish circuit along the path between both endpoints. Data is then forwarded on that circuit. After the transfer is completed, circuits can be kept for future use or can be turned down immediately.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Circuit Switching</h2> <p>When two nodes communicate with each other over a dedicated communication path, it is called circuit switching.There 'is a need of pre-specified route from which data will travels and no other data is permitted.In circuit switching, to transfer the data, circuit must be established so that the data transfer can take place.</p> <p>Circuits can be permanent or temporary. Applications which use circuit switching may have to go through three phases:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Establish a circuit</p> </li> <li> <p>Transfer the data</p> </li> <li> <p>Disconnect the circuit</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/circuit_switching.jpg\" alt=\"Circuit Switching\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Circuit switching was designed for voice applications. Telephone is the best suitable example of circuit switching. Before a user can make a call, a virtual path between caller and callee is established over the network.</p> <h2>Message Switching</h2> <p>This technique was somewhere in middle of circuit switching and packet switching. In message switching, the whole message is treated as a data unit and is switching / transferred in its entirety.</p> <p>A switch working on message switching, first receives the whole message and buffers it until there are resources available to transfer it to the next hop. If the next hop is not having enough resource to accommodate large size message, the message is stored and switch waits.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/message_switching.jpg\" alt=\"Message Switching\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>This technique was considered substitute to circuit switching. As in circuit switching the whole path is blocked for two entities only. Message switching is replaced by packet switching. Message switching has the following drawbacks:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Every switch in transit path needs enough storage to accommodate entire message.</p> </li> <li> <p>Because of store-and-forward technique and waits included until resources are available, message switching is very slow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Message switching was not a solution for streaming media and real-time applications.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Packet Switching</h2> <p>Shortcomings of message switching gave birth to an idea of packet switching. The entire message is broken down into smaller chunks called packets. The switching information is added in the header of each packet and transmitted independently.</p> <p>It is easier for intermediate networking devices to store small size packets and they do not take much resources either on carrier path or in the internal memory of switches.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/packet_switching.jpg\" alt=\"Packet Switching\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Packet switching enhances line efficiency as packets from multiple applications can be multiplexed over the carrier. The internet uses packet switching technique. Packet switching enables the user to differentiate data streams based on priorities. Packets are stored and forwarded according to their priority to provide quality of service.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

			"<head> <title>Data-link Layer Introduction</title><h2>Data-link Layer Introduction</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Data Link Layer is second layer of OSI Layered Model. This layer is one of the most complicated layers and has complex functionalities and liabilities. Data link layer hides the details of underlying hardware and represents itself to upper layer as the medium to communicate.</p> <p>Data link layer works between two hosts which are directly connected in some sense. This direct connection could be point to point or broadcast. Systems on broadcast network are said to be on same link. The work of data link layer tends to get more complex when it is dealing with multiple hosts on single collision domain.</p> <p>Data link layer is responsible for converting data stream to signals bit by bit and to send that over the underlying hardware. At the receiving end, Data link layer picks up data from hardware which are in the form of electrical signals, assembles them in a recognizable frame format, and hands over to upper layer.</p> <p>Data link layer has two sub-layers:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Logical Link Control:</strong>&nbsp;It deals with protocols, flow-control, and error control</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Media Access Control:</strong>&nbsp;It deals with actual control of media</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Functionality of Data-link Layer</h2> <p>Data link layer does many tasks on behalf of upper layer. These are:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Framing</strong></p> <p>Data-link layer takes packets from Network Layer and encapsulates them into Frames.Then, it sends each frame bit-by-bit on the hardware. At receiver&rsquo; end, data link layer picks up signals from hardware and assembles them into frames.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Addressing</strong></p> <p>Data-link layer provides layer-2 hardware addressing mechanism. Hardware address is assumed to be unique on the link. It is encoded into hardware at the time of manufacturing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Synchronization</strong></p> <p>When data frames are sent on the link, both machines must be synchronized in order to transfer to take place.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Error Control</strong></p> <p>Sometimes signals may have encountered problem in transition and the bits are flipped.These errors are detected and attempted to recover actual data bits. It also provides error reporting mechanism to the sender.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flow Control</strong></p> <p>Stations on same link may have different speed or capacity. Data-link layer ensures flow control that enables both machine to exchange data on same speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Multi-Access</strong></p> <p>When host on the shared link tries to transfer the data, it has a high probability of collision. Data-link layer provides mechanism such as CSMA/CD to equip capability of accessing a shared media among multiple Systems.</p> </li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Error Detection &amp; Correction</title><h2>Error Detection &amp; Correction</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>There are many reasons such as noise, cross-talk etc., which may help data to get corrupted during transmission. The upper layers work on some generalized view of network architecture and are not aware of actual hardware data processing.Hence, the upper layers expect error-free transmission between the systems. Most of the applications would not function expectedly if they receive erroneous data. Applications such as voice and video may not be that affected and with some errors they may still function well.</p> <p>Data-link layer uses some error control mechanism to ensure that frames (data bit streams) are transmitted with certain level of accuracy. But to understand how errors is controlled, it is essential to know what types of errors may occur.</p> <h2>Types of Errors</h2> <p>There may be three types of errors:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Single bit error</strong></p> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/single_bit_error.jpg\" alt=\"Single bit error\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>In a frame, there is only one bit, anywhere though, which is corrupt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Multiple bits error</strong></p> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/multiple_bits_error.jpg\" alt=\"Multiple bits error\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>Frame is received with more than one bits in corrupted state.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Burst error</strong></p> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/burst_error.jpg\" alt=\"Burst error\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>Frame contains more than1 consecutive bits corrupted.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Error control mechanism may involve two possible ways:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Error detection</p> </li> <li> <p>Error correction</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Error Detection</h2> <p>Errors in the received frames are detected by means of Parity Check and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). In both cases, few extra bits are sent along with actual data to confirm that bits received at other end are same as they were sent. If the counter-check at receiver&rsquo; end fails, the bits are considered corrupted.</p> <h3>Parity Check</h3> <p>One extra bit is sent along with the original bits to make number of 1s either even in case of even parity, or odd in case of odd parity.</p> <p>The sender while creating a frame counts the number of 1s in it. For example, if even parity is used and number of 1s is even then one bit with value 0 is added. This way number of 1s remains even.If the number of 1s is odd, to make it even a bit with value 1 is added.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/even_parity.jpg\" alt=\"Even Parity\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>The receiver simply counts the number of 1s in a frame. If the count of 1s is even and even parity is used, the frame is considered to be not-corrupted and is accepted. If the count of 1s is odd and odd parity is used, the frame is still not corrupted.</p> <p>If a single bit flips in transit, the receiver can detect it by counting the number of 1s. But when more than one bits are erro neous, then it is very hard for the receiver to detect the error.</p> <h3>Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)</h3> <p>CRC is a different approach to detect if the received frame contains valid data. This technique involves binary division of the data bits being sent. The divisor is generated using polynomials. The sender performs a division operation on the bits being sent and calculates the remainder. Before sending the actual bits, the sender adds the remainder at the end of the actual bits. Actual data bits plus the remainder is called a codeword. The sender transmits data bits as codewords.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/crc.jpg\" alt=\"CRC\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>At the other end, the receiver performs division operation on codewords using the same CRC divisor. If the remainder contains all zeros the data bits are accepted, otherwise it is considered as there some data corruption occurred in transit.</p> <h2>Error Correction</h2> <p>In the digital world, error correction can be done in two ways:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Backward Error Correction</strong>&nbsp; When the receiver detects an error in the data received, it requests back the sender to retransmit the data unit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Forward Error Correction</strong>&nbsp; When the receiver detects some error in the data received, it executes error-correcting code, which helps it to auto-recover and to correct some kinds of errors.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The first one, Backward Error Correction, is simple and can only be efficiently used where retransmitting is not expensive. For example, fiber optics. But in case of wireless transmission retransmitting may cost too much. In the latter case, Forward Error Correction is used.</p> <p>To correct the error in data frame, the receiver must know exactly which bit in the frame is corrupted. To locate the bit in error, redundant bits are used as parity bits for error detection.For example, we take ASCII words (7 bits data), then there could be 8 kind of information we need: first seven bits to tell us which bit is error and one more bit to tell that there is no error.</p> <p>For m data bits, r redundant bits are used. r bits can provide 2r combinations of information. In m+r bit codeword, there is possibility that the r bits themselves may get corrupted. So the number of r bits used must inform about m+r bit locations plus no-error information, i.e. m+r+1.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/required_bits.jpg\" alt=\"Required bits\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Data-link Control &amp; Protocols</title><h2>Data-link Control &amp; Protocols</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Data-link layer is responsible for implementation of point-to-point flow and error control mechanism.</p> <h2>Flow Control</h2> <p>When a data frame (Layer-2 data) is sent from one host to another over a single medium, it is required that the sender and receiver should work at the same speed. That is, sender sends at a speed on which the receiver can process and accept the data. What if the speed (hardware/software) of the sender or receiver differs? If sender is sending too fast the receiver may be overloaded, (swamped) and data may be lost.</p> <p>Two types of mechanisms can be deployed to control the flow:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Stop and Wait</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> This flow control mechanism forces the sender after transmitting a data frame to stop and wait until the acknowledgement of the data-frame sent is received. <p>&nbsp;</p> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/stop_and_wait.jpg\" alt=\"Stop and Wait\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></li> <li> <p><strong>Sliding Window</strong></p> <p>In this flow control mechanism, both sender and receiver agree on the number of data-frames after which the acknowledgement should be sent. As we learnt, stop and wait flow control mechanism wastes resources, this protocol tries to make use of underlying resources as much as possible.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Error Control</h2> <p>When data-frame is transmitted, there is a probability that data-frame may be lost in the transit or it is received corrupted. In both cases, the receiver does not receive the correct data-frame and sender does not know anything about any loss.In such case, both sender and receiver are equipped with some protocols which helps them to detect transit errors such as loss of data-frame. Hence, either the sender retransmits the data-frame or the receiver may request to resend the previous data-frame.</p> <p>Requirements for error control mechanism:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Error detection</strong>&nbsp; - The sender and receiver, either both or any, must ascertain that there is some error in the transit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Positive ACK</strong>&nbsp; - When the receiver receives a correct frame, it should acknowledge it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Negative ACK</strong>&nbsp; - When the receiver receives a damaged frame or a duplicate frame, it sends a NACK back to the sender and the sender must retransmit the correct frame.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Retransmission:</strong>&nbsp; The sender maintains a clock and sets a timeout period. If an acknowledgement of a data-frame previously transmitted does not arrive before the timeout the sender retransmits the frame, thinking that the frame or it&rsquo;s acknowledgement is lost in transit.</p> </li> </ul> <p>There are three types of techniques available which Data-link layer may deploy to control the errors by Automatic Repeat Requests (ARQ):</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Stop-and-wait ARQ</h3> <p>&nbsp;</p> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/stop_and_wait_arq.jpg\" alt=\"Stop and Wait ARQ\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>The following transition may occur in Stop-and-Wait ARQ:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>The sender maintains a timeout counter.</li> <li>When a frame is sent, the sender starts the timeout counter.</li> <li>If acknowledgement of frame comes in time, the sender transmits the next frame in queue.</li> <li>If acknowledgement does not come in time, the sender assumes that either the frame or its acknowledgement is lost in transit. Sender retransmits the frame and starts the timeout counter.</li> <li>If a negative acknowledgement is received, the sender retransmits the frame.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Go-Back-N ARQ</h3> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Stop and wait ARQ mechanism does not utilize the resources at their best.When the acknowledgement is received, the sender sits idle and does nothing. In Go-Back-N ARQ method, both sender and receiver maintain a window.</p> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/go_back_n_arq.jpg\" alt=\"Go-back-n ARQ\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>The sending-window size enables the sender to send multiple frames without receiving the acknowledgement of the previous ones. The receiving-window enables the receiver to receive multiple frames and acknowledge them. The receiver keeps track of incoming frame&rsquo;s sequence number.</p> <p>When the sender sends all the frames in window, it checks up to what sequence number it has received positive acknowledgement. If all frames are positively acknowledged, the sender sends next set of frames. If sender finds that it has received NACK or has not receive any ACK for a particular frame, it retransmits all the frames after which it does not receive any positive ACK.</p> </li> <li> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Selective Repeat ARQ</h3> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In Go-back-N ARQ, it is assumed that the receiver does not have any buffer space for its window size and has to process each frame as it comes. This enforces the sender to retransmit all the frames which are not acknowledged.</p> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/selective_repeat.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>In Selective-Repeat ARQ, the receiver while keeping track of sequence numbers, buffers the frames in memory and sends NACK for only frame which is missing or damaged.</p> <p>The sender in this case, sends only packet for which NACK is received.</p> </li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

Network layer manages options pertaining to host and network addressing, managing sub-networks, and internetworking.</p> <p>Network layer takes the responsibility for routing packets from source to destination within or outside a subnet. Two different subnet may have different addressing schemes or non-compatible addressing types. Same with protocols, two different subnet may be operating on different protocols which are not compatible with each other. Network layer has the responsibility to route the packets from source to destination, mapping different addressing schemes and protocols.</p> <h2>Layer-3 Functionalities</h2> <p>Devices which work on Network Layer mainly focus on routing. Routing may include various tasks aimed to achieve a single goal. These can be:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Addressing devices and networks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Populating routing tables or static routes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Queuing incoming and outgoing data and then forwarding them according to quality of service constraints set for those packets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Internetworking between two different subnets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Delivering packets to destination with best efforts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Provides connection oriented and connection less mechanism.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Network Layer Features</h2> <p>With its standard functionalities, Layer 3 can provide various features as:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Quality of service management</p> </li> <li> <p>Load balancing and link management</p> </li> <li> <p>Security</p> </li> <li> <p>Interrelation of different protocols and subnets with different schema.</p> </li> <li> <p>Different logical network design over the physical network design.</p> </li> <li> <p>L3 VPN and tunnels can be used to provide end to end dedicated connectivity.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Internet protocol is widely respected and deployed Network Layer protocol which helps to communicate end to end devices over the internet. It comes in two flavors. IPv4 which has ruled the world for decades but now is running out of address space.

			"<head> <title>Network Addressing</title><h2>Network Addressing</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Layer 3 network addressing is one of the major tasks of Network Layer. Network Addresses are always logical i.e. these are software based addresses which can be changed by appropriate configurations.</p> <p>A network address always points to host / node / server or it can represent a whole network. Network address is always configured on network interface card and is generally mapped by system with the MAC address (hardware address or layer-2 address) of the machine for Layer-2 communication.</p> <p>There are different kinds of network addresses in existence:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>IP</p> </li> <li> <p>IPX</p> </li> <li> <p>AppleTalk</p> </li> </ul> <p>We are discussing IP here as it is the only one we use in practice these days.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/network_addressing.jpg\" alt=\"Network Addressing\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>IP addressing provides mechanism to differentiate between hosts and network. Because IP addresses are assigned in hierarchical manner, a host always resides under a specific network.The host which needs to communicate outside its subnet, needs to know destination network address, where the packet/data is to be sent.</p> <p>Hosts in different subnet need a mechanism to locate each other. This task can be done by DNS. DNS is a server which provides Layer-3 address of remote host mapped with its domain name or FQDN. When a host acquires the Layer-3 Address (IP Address) of the remote host, it forwards all its packet to its gateway. A gateway is a router equipped with all the information which leads to route packets to the destination host.</p> <p>Routers take help of routing tables, which has the following information:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Method to reach the network</p> </li> </ul> <p>Routers upon receiving a forwarding request, forwards packet to its next hop (adjacent router) towards the destination.</p> <p>The next router on the path follows the same thing and eventually the data packet reaches its destination.</p> <p>Network address can be of one of the following:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Unicast (destined to one host)</p> </li> <li> <p>Multicast (destined to group)</p> </li> <li> <p>Broadcast (destined to all)</p> </li> <li> <p>Anycast (destined to nearest one)</p> </li> </ul> <p>A router never forwards broadcast traffic by default. Multicast traffic uses special treatment as it is most a video stream or audio with highest priority. Anycast is just similar to unicast, except that the packets are delivered to the nearest destination when multiple destinations are available.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Network Layer Routing</title><h2>Network Layer Routing</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>When a device has multiple paths to reach a destination, it always selects one path by preferring it over others. This selection process is termed as Routing. Routing is done by special network devices called routers or it can be done by means of software processes.The software based routers have limited functionality and limited scope.</p> <p>A router is always configured with some default route. A default route tells the router where to forward a packet if there is no route found for specific destination. In case there are multiple path existing to reach the same destination, router can make decision based on the following information:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Hop Count</p> </li> <li> <p>Bandwidth</p> </li> <li> <p>Metric</p> </li> <li> <p>Prefix-length</p> </li> <li> <p>Delay</p> </li> </ul> <p>Routes can be statically configured or dynamically learnt. One route can be configured to be preferred over others.</p> <h2>Unicast routing</h2> <p>Most of the traffic on the internet and intranets known as unicast data or unicast traffic is sent with specified destination. Routing unicast data over the internet is called unicast routing. It is the simplest form of routing because the destination is already known. Hence the router just has to look up the routing table and forward the packet to next hop.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/unicast_routing.jpg\" alt=\"Unicast routing\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Broadcast routing</h2> <p>By default, the broadcast packets are not routed and forwarded by the routers on any network. Routers create broadcast domains. But it can be configured to forward broadcasts in some special cases. A broadcast message is destined to all network devices.</p> <p>Broadcast routing can be done in two ways (algorithm):</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>A router creates a data packet and then sends it to each host one by one. In this case, the router creates multiple copies of single data packet with different destination addresses. All packets are sent as unicast but because they are sent to all, it simulates as if router is broadcasting.</p> <p>This method consumes lots of bandwidth and router must destination address of each node.</p> </li> <li> <p>Secondly, when router receives a packet that is to be broadcasted, it simply floods those packets out of all interfaces. All routers are configured in the same way.</p> <img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/broadcast_routing.jpg\" alt=\"Broadcast routing\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /> <p>This method is easy on router's CPU but may cause the problem of duplicate packets received from peer routers.</p> <p>Reverse path forwarding is a technique, in which router knows in advance about its predecessor from where it should receive broadcast. This technique is used to detect and discard duplicates.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Multicast Routing</h2> <p>Multicast routing is special case of broadcast routing with significance difference and challenges. In broadcast routing, packets are sent to all nodes even if they do not want it. But in Multicast routing, the data is sent to only nodes which wants to receive the packets.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/multicast_routing.jpg\" alt=\"Multicast routing\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>The router must know that there are nodes, which wish to receive multicast packets (or stream) then only it should forward. Multicast routing works spanning tree protocol to avoid looping.</p> <p>Multicast routing also uses reverse path Forwarding technique, to detect and discard duplicates and loops.</p> <h2>Anycast Routing</h2> <p>Anycast packet forwarding is a mechanism where multiple hosts can have same logical address. When a packet destined to this logical address is received, it is sent to the host which is nearest in routing topology.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images//Anycast_routing.jpg\" alt=\"Anycast routing\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Anycast routing is done with help of DNS server. Whenever an Anycast packet is received it is enquired with DNS to where to send it. DNS provides the IP address which is the nearest IP configured on it.</p> <h2>Unicast Routing Protocols</h2> <p>There are two kinds of routing protocols available to route unicast packets:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Distance Vector Routing Protocol</h3> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Distance Vector is simple routing protocol which takes routing decision on the number of hops between source and destination. A route with less number of hops is considered as the best route. Every router advertises its set best routes to other routers. Ultimately, all routers build up their network topology based on the advertisements of their peer routers,</p> <p>For example Routing Information Protocol (RIP).</p> </li> <li> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Link State Routing Protocol</h3> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Link State protocol is slightly complicated protocol than Distance Vector. It takes into account the states of links of all the routers in a network. This technique helps routes build a common graph of the entire network. All routers then calculate their best path for routing purposes.for example, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate System to Intermediate System (ISIS).</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Multicast Routing Protocols</h2> <p>Unicast routing protocols use graphs while Multicast routing protocols use trees, i.e. spanning tree to avoid loops. The optimal tree is called shortest path spanning tree.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>DVMRP</strong>&nbsp; - Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>MOSPF</strong>&nbsp; - Multicast Open Shortest Path First</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>CBT</strong>&nbsp; - Core Based Tree</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>PIM</strong>&nbsp; - Protocol independent Multicast</p> </li> </ul> <p>Protocol Independent Multicast is commonly used now. It has two flavors:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>PIM Dense Mode</strong></p> <p>This mode uses source-based trees. It is used in dense environment such as LAN.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>PIM Sparse Mode</strong></p> <p>This mode uses shared trees. It is used in sparse environment such as WAN.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Routing Algorithms</h2> <p>The routing algorithms are as follows:</p> <h3>Flooding</h3> <p>Flooding is simplest method packet forwarding. When a packet is received, the routers send it to all the interfaces except the one on which it was received. This creates too much burden on the network and lots of duplicate packets wandering in the network.</p> <p>Time to Live (TTL) can be used to avoid infinite looping of packets. There exists another approach for flooding, which is called Selective Flooding to reduce the overhead on the network. In this method, the router does not flood out on all the interfaces, but selective ones.</p> <h3>Shortest Path</h3> <p>Routing decision in networks, are mostly taken on the basis of cost between source and destination. Hop count plays major role here. Shortest path is a technique which uses various algorithms to decide a path with minimum number of hops.</p> <p>Common shortest path algorithms are:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Dijkstra's algorithm</p> </li> <li> <p>Bellman Ford algorithm</p> </li> <li> <p>Floyd Warshall algorithm</p> </li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Internetworking</title><h2>Internetworking</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>In real world scenario, networks under same administration are generally scattered geographically. There may exist requirement of connecting two different networks of same kind as well as of different kinds. Routing between two networks is called internetworking.</p> <p>Networks can be considered different based on various parameters such as, Protocol, topology, Layer-2 network and addressing scheme.</p> <p>In internetworking, routers have knowledge of each other&rsquo;s address and addresses beyond them. They can be statically configured go on different network or they can learn by using internetworking routing protocol.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/routing.jpg\" alt=\"Routing\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>Routing protocols which are used within an organization or administration are called Interior Gateway Protocols or IGP. RIP, OSPF are examples of IGP. Routing between different organizations or administrations may have Exterior Gateway Protocol, and there is only one EGP i.e. Border Gateway Protocol.</p> <h2>Tunneling</h2> <p>If they are two geographically separate networks, which want to communicate with each other, they may deploy a dedicated line between or they have to pass their data through intermediate networks.</p> <p>Tunneling is a mechanism by which two or more same networks communicate with each other, by passing intermediate networking complexities. Tunneling is configured at both ends.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/tunneling.jpg\" alt=\"Tunneling\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>When the data enters from one end of Tunnel, it is tagged. This tagged data is then routed inside the intermediate or transit network to reach the other end of Tunnel. When data exists the Tunnel its tag is removed and delivered to the other part of the network.</p> <p>Both ends seem as if they are directly connected and tagging makes data travel through transit network without any modifications.</p> <h2>Packet Fragmentation</h2> <p>Most Ethernet segments have their maximum transmission unit (MTU) fixed to 1500 bytes. A data packet can have more or less packet length depending upon the application. Devices in the transit path also have their hardware and software capabilities which tell what amount of data that device can handle and what size of packet it can process.</p> <p>If the data packet size is less than or equal to the size of packet the transit network can handle, it is processed neutrally. If the packet is larger, it is broken into smaller pieces and then forwarded. This is called packet fragmentation. Each fragment contains the same destination and source address and routed through transit path easily. At the receiving end it is assembled again.</p> <p>If a packet with DF (don&rsquo;t fragment) bit set to 1 comes to a router which can not handle the packet because of its length, the packet is dropped.</p> <p>When a packet is received by a router has its MF (more fragments) bit set to 1, the router then knows that it is a fragmented packet and parts of the original packet is on the way.</p> <p>If packet is fragmented too small, the overhead is increases. If the packet is fragmented too large, intermediate router may not be able to process it and it might get dropped.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Network Layer Protocols</title><h2>Network Layer Protocols</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Every computer in a network has an IP address by which it can be uniquely identified and addressed. An IP address is Layer-3 (Network Layer) logical address. This address may change every time a computer restarts. A computer can have one IP at one instance of time and another IP at some different time.</p> <h2>Address Resolution Protocol(ARP)</h2> <p>While communicating, a host needs Layer-2 (MAC) address of the destination machine which belongs to the same broadcast domain or network. A MAC address is physically burnt into the Network Interface Card (NIC) of a machine and it never changes.</p> <p>On the other hand, IP address on the public domain is rarely changed. If the NIC is changed in case of some fault, the MAC address also changes. This way, for Layer-2 communication to take place, a mapping between the two is required.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/arp.jpg\" alt=\"ARP Mechanism\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>To know the MAC address of remote host on a broadcast domain, a computer wishing to initiate communication sends out an ARP broadcast message asking, &ldquo;Who has this IP address?&rdquo; Because it is a broadcast, all hosts on the network segment (broadcast domain) receive this packet and process it. ARP packet contains the IP address of destination host, the sending host wishes to talk to. When a host receives an ARP packet destined to it, it replies back with its own MAC address.</p> <p>Once the host gets destination MAC address, it can communicate with remote host using Layer-2 link protocol. This MAC to IP mapping is saved into ARP cache of both sending and receiving hosts. Next time, if they require to communicate, they can directly refer to their respective ARP cache.</p> <p>Reverse ARP is a mechanism where host knows the MAC address of remote host but requires to know IP address to communicate.</p> <h2>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)</h2> <p>ICMP is network diagnostic and error reporting protocol. ICMP belongs to IP protocol suite and uses IP as carrier protocol. After constructing ICMP packet, it is encapsulated in IP packet. Because IP itself is a best-effort non-reliable protocol, so is ICMP.</p> <p>Any feedback about network is sent back to the originating host. If some error in the network occurs, it is reported by means of ICMP. ICMP contains dozens of diagnostic and error reporting messages.</p> <p>ICMP-echo and ICMP-echo-reply are the most commonly used ICMP messages to check the reachability of end-to-end hosts. When a host receives an ICMP-echo request, it is bound to send back an ICMP-echo-reply. If there is any problem in the transit network, the ICMP will report that problem.</p> <h2>Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4)</h2> <p>IPv4 is 32-bit addressing scheme used as TCP/IP host addressing mechanism. IP addressing enables every host on the TCP/IP network to be uniquely identifiable.</p> <p>IPv4 provides hierarchical addressing scheme which enables it to divide the network into sub-networks, each with well-defined number of hosts. IP addresses are divided into many categories:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Class A</strong>&nbsp; - it uses first octet for network addresses and last three octets for host addressing</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Class B</strong>&nbsp; - it uses first two octets for network addresses and last two for host addressing</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Class C</strong>&nbsp; - it uses first three octets for network addresses and last one for host addressing</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Class D</strong>&nbsp; - it provides flat IP addressing scheme in contrast to hierarchical structure for above three.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Class E</strong>&nbsp; - It is used as experimental.</p> </li> </ul> <p>IPv4 also has well-defined address spaces to be used as private addresses (not routable on internet), and public addresses (provided by ISPs and are routable on internet).</p> <p>Though IP is not reliable one; it provides &lsquo;Best-Effort-Delivery&rsquo; mechanism.</p> <h2>Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)</h2> <p>Exhaustion of IPv4 addresses gave birth to a next generation Internet Protocol version 6. IPv6 addresses its nodes with 128-bit wide address providing plenty of address space for future to be used on entire planet or beyond.</p> <p>IPv6 has introduced Anycast addressing but has removed the concept of broadcasting. IPv6 enables devices to self-acquire an IPv6 address and communicate within that subnet. This auto-configuration removes the dependability of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers. This way, even if the DHCP server on that subnet is down, the hosts can communicate with each other.</p> <p>IPv6 provides new feature of IPv6 mobility. Mobile IPv6 equipped machines can roam around without the need of changing their IP addresses.</p> <p>IPv6 is still in transition phase and is expected to replace IPv4 completely in coming years. At present, there are few networks which are running on IPv6. There are some transition mechanisms available for IPv6 enabled networks to speak and roam around different networks easily on IPv4. These are:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Dual stack implementation</li> <li>Tunneling</li> <li>NAT-PT</li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

If ACK is cleared to 0, it indicates that packet does not contain any acknowledgement.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>PSH</strong>&nbsp;- When set, it is a request to the receiving station to PUSH data (as soon as it comes) to the receiving application without buffering it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>RST</strong>&nbsp;- Reset flag has the following features:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>It is used to refuse an incoming connection.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is used to reject a segment.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is used to restart a connection.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>SYN</strong>&nbsp;- This flag is used to set up a connection between hosts.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>FIN</strong>&nbsp;- This flag is used to release a connection and no more data is exchanged thereafter. Because packets with SYN and FIN flags have sequence numbers, they are processed in correct order.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Windows Size</strong>&nbsp; - This field is used for flow control between two stations and indicates the amount of buffer (in bytes) the receiver has allocated for a segment, i.e. how much data is the receiver expecting.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Checksum</strong>&nbsp;- This field contains the checksum of Header, Data and Pseudo Headers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Urgent Pointer</strong>&nbsp; - It points to the urgent data byte if URG flag is set to 1.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Options</strong>&nbsp; - It facilitates additional options which are not covered by the regular header. Option field is always described in 32-bit words. If this field contains data less than 32-bit, padding is used to cover the remaining bits to reach 32-bit boundary.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Addressing</h2> <p>TCP communication between two remote hosts is done by means of port numbers (TSAPs). Ports numbers can range from 0 &ndash; 65535 which are divided as:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>System Ports (0 &ndash; 1023)</li> <li>User Ports ( 1024 &ndash; 49151)</li> <li>Private/Dynamic Ports (49152 &ndash; 65535)</li> </ul> <h2>Connection Management</h2> <p>TCP communication works in Server/Client model. The client initiates the connection and the server either accepts or rejects it. Three-way handshaking is used for connection management.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/TCP_handshake.jpg\" alt=\"TCP Handshake\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h3>Establishment</h3> <p>Client initiates the connection and sends the segment with a Sequence number. Server acknowledges it back with its own Sequence number and ACK of client&rsquo;s segment which is one more than client&rsquo;s Sequence number. Client after receiving ACK of its segment sends an acknowledgement of Server&rsquo;s response.</p> <h3>Release</h3> <p>Either of server and client can send TCP segment with FIN flag set to 1. When the receiving end responds it back by ACKnowledging FIN, that direction of TCP communication is closed and connection is released.</p> <h2>Bandwidth Management</h2> <p>TCP uses the concept of window size to accommodate the need of Bandwidth management. Window size tells the sender at the remote end, the number of data byte segments the receiver at this end can receive. TCP uses slow start phase by using window size 1 and increases the window size exponentially after each successful communication.</p> <p>For example, the client uses windows size 2 and sends 2 bytes of data. When the acknowledgement of this segment received the windows size is doubled to 4 and next sent the segment sent will be 4 data bytes long. When the acknowledgement of 4-byte data segment is received, the client sets windows size to 8 and so on.</p> <p>If an acknowledgement is missed, i.e. data lost in transit network or it received NACK, then the window size is reduced to half and slow start phase starts again.</p> <h2>Error Control &amp;and Flow Control</h2> <p>TCP uses port numbers to know what application process it needs to handover the data segment. Along with that, it uses sequence numbers to synchronize itself with the remote host. All data segments are sent and received with sequence numbers. The Sender knows which last data segment was received by the Receiver when it gets ACK. The Receiver knows about the last segment sent by the Sender by referring to the sequence number of recently received packet.</p> <p>If the sequence number of a segment recently received does not match with the sequence number the receiver was expecting, then it is discarded and NACK is sent back. If two segments arrive with the same sequence number, the TCP timestamp value is compared to make a decision.</p> <h2>Multiplexing</h2> <p>The technique to combine two or more data streams in one session is called Multiplexing. When a TCP client initializes a connection with Server, it always refers to a well-defined port number which indicates the application process. The client itself uses a randomly generated port number from private port number pools.</p> <p>Using TCP Multiplexing, a client can communicate with a number of different application process in a single session. For example, a client requests a web page which in turn contains different types of data (HTTP, SMTP, FTP etc.) the TCP session timeout is increased and the session is kept open for longer time so that the three-way handshake overhead can be avoided.</p> <p>This enables the client system to receive multiple connection over single virtual connection. These virtual connections are not good for Servers if the timeout is too long.</p> <h2>Congestion Control</h2> <p>When large amount of data is fed to system which is not capable of handling it, congestion occurs. TCP controls congestion by means of Window mechanism. TCP sets a window size telling the other end how much data segment to send. TCP may use three algorithms for congestion control:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Additive increase, Multiplicative Decrease</p> </li> <li> <p>Slow Start</p> </li> <li> <p>Timeout React</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Timer Management</h2> <p>TCP uses different types of timer to control and management various tasks:</p> <h3>Keep-alive timer:</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>This timer is used to check the integrity and validity of a connection.</p> </li> <li> <p>When keep-alive time expires, the host sends a probe to check if the connection still exists.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Retransmission timer:</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>This timer maintains stateful session of data sent.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the acknowledgement of sent data does not receive within the Retransmission time, the data segment is sent again.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Persist timer:</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>TCP session can be paused by either host by sending Window Size 0.</p> </li> <li> <p>To resume the session a host needs to send Window Size with some larger value.</p> </li> <li> <p>If this segment never reaches the other end, both ends may wait for each other for infinite time.</p> </li> <li> <p>When the Persist timer expires, the host re-sends its window size to let the other end know.</p> </li> <li> <p>Persist Timer helps avoid deadlocks in communication.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Timed-Wait:</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>After releasing a connection, either of the hosts waits for a Timed-Wait time to terminate the connection completely.</p> </li> <li> <p>This is in order to make sure that the other end has received the acknowledgement of its connection termination request.</p> </li> <li> <p>Timed-out can be a maximum of 240 seconds (4 minutes).</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Crash Recovery</h2> <p>TCP is very reliable protocol. It provides sequence number to each of byte sent in segment. It provides the feedback mechanism i.e. when a host receives a packet, it is bound to ACK that packet having the next sequence number expected (if it is not the last segment).</p> <p>When a TCP Server crashes mid-way communication and re-starts its process it sends TPDU broadcast to all its hosts. The hosts can then send the last data segment which was never unacknowledged and carry onwards.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>User Datagram Protocol</title><h2>User Datagram Protocol</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is simplest Transport Layer communication protocol available of the TCP/IP protocol suite. It involves minimum amount of communication mechanism. UDP is said to be an unreliable transport protocol but it uses IP services which provides best effort delivery mechanism.</p> <p>In UDP, the receiver does not generate an acknowledgement of packet received and in turn, the sender does not wait for any acknowledgement of packet sent. This shortcoming makes this protocol unreliable as well as easier on processing.</p> <h2>Requirement of UDP</h2> <p>A question may arise, why do we need an unreliable protocol to transport the data? We deploy UDP where the acknowledgement packets share significant amount of bandwidth along with the actual data. For example, in case of video streaming, thousands of packets are forwarded towards its users. Acknowledging all the packets is troublesome and may contain huge amount of bandwidth wastage. The best delivery mechanism of underlying IP protocol ensures best efforts to deliver its packets, but even if some packets in video streaming get lost, the impact is not calamitous and can be ignored easily. Loss of few packets in video and voice traffic sometimes goes unnoticed.</p> <h2>Features</h2> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>UDP is used when acknowledgement of data does not hold any significance.</p> </li> <li> <p>UDP is good protocol for data flowing in one direction.</p> </li> <li> <p>UDP is simple and suitable for query based communications.</p> </li> <li> <p>UDP is not connection oriented.</p> </li> <li> <p>UDP does not provide congestion control mechanism.</p> </li> <li> <p>UDP does not guarantee ordered delivery of data.</p> </li> <li> <p>UDP is stateless.</p> </li> <li> <p>UDP is suitable protocol for streaming applications such as VoIP, multimedia streaming.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>UDP Header</h2> <p>UDP header is as simple as its function.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/UDP_Header.jpg\" alt=\"UDP Header\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>UDP header contains four main parameters:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Source Port</strong>&nbsp; - This 16 bits information is used to identify the source port of the packet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Destination Port</strong>&nbsp; - This 16 bits information, is used identify application level service on destination machine.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Length</strong>&nbsp; - Length field specifies the entire length of UDP packet (including header). It is 16-bits field and minimum value is 8-byte, i.e. the size of UDP header itself.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Checksum</strong>&nbsp; - This field stores the checksum value generated by the sender before sending. IPv4 has this field as optional so when checksum field does not contain any value it is made 0 and all its bits are set to zero.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>UDP application</h2> <p>Here are few applications where UDP is used to transmit data:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Domain Name Services</p> </li> <li> <p>Simple Network Management Protocol</p> </li> <li> <p>Trivial File Transfer Protocol</p> </li> <li> <p>Routing Information Protocol</p> </li> <li> <p>Kerberos</p> </li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

			"<head> <title>Application Layer Introduction</title> </head><h2>Application Layer Introduction</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Application layer is the top most layer in OSI and TCP/IP layered model. This layer exists in both layered Models because of its significance, of interacting with user and user applications. This layer is for applications which are involved in communication system.</p> <p>A user may or may not directly interacts with the applications. Application layer is where the actual communication is initiated and reflects. Because this layer is on the top of the layer stack, it does not serve any other layers. Application layer takes the help of Transport and all layers below it to communicate or transfer its data to the remote host.</p> <p>When an application layer protocol wants to communicate with its peer application layer protocol on remote host, it hands over the data or information to the Transport layer. The transport layer does the rest with the help of all the layers below it.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/application_layer.jpg\" alt=\"Application Layer\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>There&rsquo;is an ambiguity in understanding Application Layer and its protocol. Not every user application can be put into Application Layer. except those applications which interact with the communication system. For example, designing software or text-editor cannot be considered as application layer programs.</p> <p>On the other hand, when we use a Web Browser, which is actually using Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to interact with the network. HTTP is Application Layer protocol.</p> <p>Another example is File Transfer Protocol, which helps a user to transfer text based or binary files across the network. A user can use this protocol in either GUI based software like FileZilla or CuteFTP and the same user can use FTP in Command Line mode.</p> <p>Hence, irrespective of which software you use, it is the protocol which is considered at Application Layer used by that software. DNS is a protocol which helps user application protocols such as HTTP to accomplish its work.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Client Server Model</title><h2>Client Server Model</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Two remote application processes can communicate mainly in two different fashions:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Peer-to-peer:</strong>&nbsp;Both remote processes are executing at same level and they exchange data using some shared resource.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Client-Server:</strong>&nbsp;One remote process acts as a Client and requests some resource from another application process acting as Server.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In client-server model, any process can act as Server or Client. It is not the type of machine, size of the machine, or its computing power which makes it server; it is the ability of serving request that makes a machine a server.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/client_server.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>A system can act as Server and Client simultaneously. That is, one process is acting as Server and another is acting as a client. This may also happen that both client and server processes reside on the same machine.</p> <h2>Communication</h2> <p>Two processes in client-server model can interact in various ways:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Sockets</p> </li> <li> <p>Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Sockets</h3> <p>In this paradigm, the process acting as Server opens a socket using a well-known (or known by client) port and waits until some client request comes. The second process acting as a Client also opens a socket but instead of waiting for an incoming request, the client processes &lsquo;requests first&rsquo;.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/sockets.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>When the request is reached to server, it is served. It can either be an information sharing or resource request.</p> <h3>Remote Procedure Call</h3> <p>This is a mechanism where one process interacts with another by means of procedure calls. One process (client) calls the procedure lying on remote host. The process on remote host is said to be Server. Both processes are allocated stubs. This communication happens in the following way:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The client process calls the client stub. It passes all the parameters pertaining to program local to it.</p> </li> <li> <p>All parameters are then packed (marshalled) and a system call is made to send them to other side of the network.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kernel sends the data over the network and the other end receives it.</p> </li> <li> <p>The remote host passes data to the server stub where it is unmarshalled.</p> </li> <li> <p>The parameters are passed to the procedure and the procedure is then executed.</p> </li> <li> <p>The result is sent back to the client in the same manner.</p> </li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",
			"<head> <title>Application Protocols</title><h2>Application Protocols</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>There are several protocols which work for users in Application Layer. Application layer protocols can be broadly divided into two categories:</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Protocols which are used by users.For email for example, eMail.</p> </li> <li> <p>Protocols which help and support protocols used by users.For example DNS.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Few of Application layer protocols are described below:</p> <h2>Domain Name System</h2> <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) works on Client Server model. It uses UDP protocol for transport layer communication. DNS uses hierarchical domain based naming scheme. The DNS server is configured with Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) and email addresses mapped with their respective Internet Protocol addresses.</p> <p>A DNS server is requested with FQDN and it responds back with the IP address mapped with it. DNS uses UDP port 53.</p> <h2>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</h2> <p>The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to transfer electronic mail from one user to another. This task is done by means of email client software (User Agents) the user is using. User Agents help the user to type and format the email and store it until internet is available. When an email is submitted to send, the sending process is handled by Message Transfer Agent which is normally comes inbuilt in email client software.</p> <p>Message Transfer Agent uses SMTP to forward the email to another Message Transfer Agent (Server side). While SMTP is used by end user to only send the emails, the Servers normally use SMTP to send as well as receive emails. SMTP uses TCP port number 25 and 587.</p> <p>Client software uses Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) or POP protocols to receive emails.</p> <h2>File Transfer Protocol</h2> <p>The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the most widely used protocol for file transfer over the network. FTP uses TCP/IP for communication and it works on TCP port 21. FTP works on Client/Server Model where a client requests file from Server and server sends requested resource back to the client.</p> <p>FTP uses out-of-band controlling i.e. FTP uses TCP port 20 for exchanging controlling information and the actual data is sent over TCP port 21.</p> <p>The client requests the server for a file. When the server receives a request for a file, it opens a TCP connection for the client and transfers the file. After the transfer is complete, the server closes the connection. For a second file, client requests again and the server reopens a new TCP connection.</p> <h2>Post Office Protocol (POP)</h2> <p>The Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP 3) is a simple mail retrieval protocol used by User Agents (client email software) to retrieve mails from mail server.</p> <p>When a client needs to retrieve mails from server, it opens a connection with the server on TCP port 110. User can then access his mails and download them to the local computer. POP3 works in two modes. The most common mode the delete mode, is to delete the emails from remote server after they are downloaded to local machines. The second mode, the keep mode, does not delete the email from mail server and gives the user an option to access mails later on mail server.</p> <h2>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h2> <p>The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of World Wide Web. Hypertext is well organized documentation system which uses hyperlinks to link the pages in the text documents. HTTP works on client server model. When a user wants to access any HTTP page on the internet, the client machine at user end initiates a TCP connection to server on port 80. When the server accepts the client request, the client is authorized to access web pages.</p> <p>To access the web pages, a client normally uses web browsers, who are responsible for initiating, maintaining, and closing TCP connections. HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means the Server maintains no information about earlier requests by clients.</p> <p>HTTP versions</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>HTTP 1.0 uses non persistent HTTP. At most one object can be sent over a single TCP connection.</p> </li> <li> <p>HTTP 1.1 uses persistent HTTP. In this version, multiple objects can be sent over a single TCP connection.</p> </li> </ul> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>",

            "<h2>Network Security &ndash; Overview</h2> <p>In this modern era, organizations greatly rely on computer networks to share information throughout the organization in an efficient and productive manner. Organizational computer networks are now becoming large and ubiquitous. Assuming that each staff member has a dedicated workstation, a large scale company would have few thousands workstations and many server on the network.</p> <p>It is likely that these workstations may not be centrally managed, nor would they have perimeter protection. They may have a variety of operating systems, hardware, software, and protocols, with different level of cyber awareness among users. Now imagine, these thousands of workstations on company network are directly connected to the Internet. This sort of unsecured network becomes a target for an attack which holds valuable information and displays vulnerabilities.</p> <p>In this chapter, we describe the major vulnerabilities of the network and significance of network security. In subsequent chapters, we will discuss the methods to achieve the same.</p> <h2>Physical Network</h2> <p>A network is defined as two or more computing devices connected together for sharing resources efficiently. Further, connecting two or more networks together is known as&nbsp;<strong>internetworking</strong>. Thus, the Internet is just an internetwork &ndash; a collection of interconnected networks.</p> <p>For setting up its internal network, an organization has various options. It can use a wired network or a wireless network to connect all workstations. Nowadays, organizations are mostly using a combination of both wired and wireless networks.</p> <h3>Wired &amp; Wireless Networks</h3> <p>In a wired network, devices are connected to each other using cables. Typically, wired networks are based on Ethernet protocol where devices are connected using the Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) cables to the different switches. These switches are further connected to the network router for accessing the Internet.</p> <p>In wireless network, the device is connected to an access point through radio transmissions. The access points are further connected through cables to switch/router for external network access.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/wired_and_wireless_networks.jpg\" alt=\"Wired and Wireless Networks\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>Wireless networks have gained popularity due to the mobility offered by them. Mobile devices need not be tied to a cable and can roam freely within the wireless network range. This ensures efficient information sharing and boosts productivity.</p> <h3>Vulnerabilities &amp; Attacks</h3> <p>The common vulnerability that exists in both wired and wireless networks is an &ldquo;unauthorized access&rdquo; to a network. An attacker can connect his device to a network though unsecure hub/switch port. In this regard, wireless network are considered less secure than wired network, because wireless network can be easily accessed without any physical connection.</p> <p>After accessing, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to launch attacks such as &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Sniffing the packet data to steal valuable information.</p> </li> <li> <p>Denial of service to legitimate users on a network by flooding the network medium with spurious packets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Spoofing physical identities (MAC) of legitimate hosts and then stealing data or further launching a &lsquo;man-in-the-middle&rsquo; attack.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Network Protocol</h2> <p>Network Protocol is a set of rules that govern communications between devices connected on a network. They include mechanisms for making connections, as well as formatting rules for data packaging for messages sent and received.</p> <p>Several computer network protocols have been developed each designed for specific purposes. The popular and widely used protocols are TCP/IP with associated higher- and lower-level protocols.</p> <h3>TCP/IP Protocol</h3> <p><strong>Transmission Control Protocol</strong>&nbsp;(TCP) and&nbsp;<strong>Internet Protocol</strong>&nbsp;(IP) are two distinct computer network protocols mostly used together. Due to their popularity and wide adoption, they are built in all operating systems of networked devices.</p> <p>IP corresponds to the Network layer (Layer 3) whereas TCP corresponds to the Transport layer (Layer 4) in OSI. TCP/IP applies to network communications where the TCP transport is used to deliver data across IP networks.</p> <p>TCP/IP protocols are commonly used with other protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SSH at application layer and Ethernet at the data link/physical layer.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/tcp_ip_protocol.jpg\" alt=\"TCP/IP Protocol\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>TCP/IP protocol suite was created in 1980 as an internetworking solution with very little concern for security aspects.</p> <p>It was developed for a communication in the limited trusted network. However, over a period, this protocol became the de-facto standard for the unsecured Internet communication.</p> <p>Some of the common security vulnerabilities of TCP/IP protocol suits are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>HTTP is an application layer protocol in TCP/IP suite used for transfer files that make up the web pages from the web servers. These transfers are done in plain text and an intruder can easily read the data packets exchanged between the server and a client.</p> </li> <li> <p>Another HTTP vulnerability is a weak authentication between the client and the web server during the initializing of the session. This vulnerability can lead to a session hijacking attack where the attacker steals an HTTP session of the legitimate user.</p> </li> <li> <p>TCP protocol vulnerability is three-way handshake for connection establishment. An attacker can launch a denial of service attack &ldquo;SYN-flooding&rdquo; to exploit this vulnerability. He establishes lot of half-opened sessions by not completing handshake. This leads to server overloading and eventually a crash.</p> </li> <li> <p>IP layer is susceptible to many vulnerabilities. Through an IP protocol header modification, an attacker can launch an IP spoofing attack.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Apart from the above-mentioned, many other security vulnerabilities exist in the TCP/IP Protocol family in design as well in its implementation.</p> <p>Incidentally, in TCP/IP based network communication, if one layer is hacked, the other layers do not become aware of the hack and the entire communication gets compromised. Hence, there is need to employ security controls at each layer to ensure foolproof security.</p> <h3>DNS Protocol</h3> <p><strong>Domain Name System</strong>&nbsp;(DNS) is used to resolve host domain names to IP addresses. Network users depend on DNS functionality mainly during browsing the Internet by typing a URL in the web browser.</p> <p>In an attack on DNS, an attacker&rsquo;s aim is to modify a legitimate DNS record so that it gets resolved to an incorrect IP address. It can direct all traffic for that IP to the wrong computer. An attacker can either exploit DNS protocol vulnerability or compromise the DNS server for materializing an attack.</p> <p><strong>DNS cache poisoning</strong>&nbsp;is an attack exploiting a vulnerability found in the DNS protocol. An attacker may poison the cache by forging a response to a recursive DNS query sent by a resolver to an authoritative server. Once, the cache of DNS resolver is poisoned, the host will get directed to a malicious website and may compromise credential information by communication to this site.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/dns_protocol.jpg\" alt=\"DNS Protocol\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <h3>ICMP Protocol</h3> <p><strong>Internet Control Management Protocol</strong>&nbsp;(ICMP) is a basic network management protocol of the TCP/IP networks. It is used to send error and control messages regarding the status of networked devices.</p> <p>ICMP is an integral part of the IP network implementation and thus is present in very network setup. ICMP has its own vulnerabilities and can be abused to launch an attack on a network.</p> <p>The common attacks that can occur on a network due to ICMP vulnerabilities are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>ICMP allows an attacker to carry out network reconnaissance to determine network topology and paths into the network. ICMP sweep involves discovering all host IP addresses which are alive in the entire target&rsquo;s network.</p> </li> <li> <p>Trace route is a popular ICMP utility that is used to map target networking by describing the path in real-time from the client to the remote host.</p> </li> <li> <p>An attacker can launch a denial of service attack using the ICMP vulnerability. This attack involves sending IPMP ping packets that exceeds 65,535 bytes to the target device. The target computer fails to handle this packet properly and can cause the operating system to crush.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Other protocols such as ARP, DHCP, SMTP, etc. also have their vulnerabilities that can be exploited by the attacker to compromise the network security. We will discuss some of these vulnerabilities in later chapters.</p> <p>The least concern for the security aspect during design and implementation of protocols has turned into a main cause of threats to the network security.</p> <h2>Goals of Network Security</h2> <p>As discussed in earlier sections, there exists large number of vulnerabilities in the network. Thus, during transmission, data is highly vulnerable to attacks. An attacker can target the communication channel, obtain the data, and read the same or re-insert a false message to achieve his nefarious aims.</p> <p>Network security is not only concerned about the security of the computers at each end of the communication chain; however, it aims to ensure that the entire network is secure.</p> <p>Network security entails protecting the usability, reliability, integrity, and safety of network and data. Effective network security defeats a variety of threats from entering or spreading on a network.</p> <p>The primary goal of network security are Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. These three pillars of Network Security are often represented as&nbsp;<strong>CIA triangle</strong>.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The function of confidentiality is to protect precious business data from unauthorized persons. Confidentiality part of network security makes sure that the data is available only to the intended and authorized persons.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Integrity</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This goal means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and consistency of data. The function of integrity is to make sure that the data is reliable and is not changed by unauthorized persons.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Availability</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The function of availability in Network Security is to make sure that the data, network resources/services are continuously available to the legitimate users, whenever they require it.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Achieving Network Security</h2> <p>Ensuring network security may appear to be very simple. The goals to be achieved seems to be straightforward. But in reality, the mechanisms used to achieve these goals are highly complex, and understanding them involves sound reasoning.</p> <p><strong>International Telecommunication Union</strong>&nbsp;(ITU), in its recommendation on security architecture X.800, has defined certain mechanisms to bring the standardization in methods to achieve network security. Some of these mechanisms are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>En-cipherment</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This mechanism provides data confidentiality services by transforming data into not-readable forms for the unauthorized persons. This mechanism uses encryption-decryption algorithm with secret keys.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Digital signatures</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This mechanism is the electronic equivalent of ordinary signatures in electronic data. It provides authenticity of the data.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Access control</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This mechanism is used to provide access control services. These mechanisms may use the identification and authentication of an entity to determine and enforce the access rights of the entity.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Having developed and identified various security mechanisms for achieving network security, it is essential to decide where to apply them; both physically (at what location) and logically (at what layer of an architecture such as TCP/IP).</p> <h3>Security Mechanisms at Networking Layers</h3> <p>Several security mechanisms have been developed in such a way that they can be developed at a specific layer of the OSI network layer model.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Security at Application Layer</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Security measures used at this layer are application specific. Different types of application would need separate security measures. In order to ensure application layer security, the applications need to be modified.</p> <p>It is considered that designing a cryptographically sound application protocol is very difficult and implementing it properly is even more challenging. Hence, application layer security mechanisms for protecting network communications are preferred to be only standards-based solutions that have been in use for some time.</p> <p>An example of application layer security protocol is Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME), which is commonly used to encrypt e-mail messages. DNSSEC is another protocol at this layer used for secure exchange of DNS query messages.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Security at Transport Layer</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Security measures at this layer can be used to protect the data in a single communication session between two hosts. The most common use for transport layer security protocols is protecting the HTTP and FTP session traffic. The Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) are the most common protocols used for this purpose.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Network Layer</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Security measures at this layer can be applied to all applications; thus, they are not application-specific. All network communications between two hosts or networks can be protected at this layer without modifying any application. In some environments, network layer security protocol such as Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) provides a much better solution than transport or application layer controls because of the difficulties in adding controls to individual applications. However, security protocols at this layer provides less communication flexibility that may be required by some applications.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Incidentally, a security mechanism designed to operate at a higher layer cannot provide protection for data at lower layers, because the lower layers perform functions of which the higher layers are not aware. Hence, it may be necessary to deploy multiple security mechanisms for enhancing the network security.</p> <p>In the following chapters of the tutorial, we will discuss the security mechanisms employed at different layers of OSI networking architecture for achieving network security.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

            "<h1>Network Security &ndash; Application Layer</h1> <p>Various business services are now offered online though client-server applications. The most popular forms are web application and e-mail. In both applications, the client communicates to the designated server and obtains services.</p> <p>While using a service from any server application, the client and server exchange a lot of information on the underlying intranet or Internet. We are aware of fact that these information transactions are vulnerable to various attacks.</p> <p>Network security entails securing data against attacks while it is in transit on a network. To achieve this goal, many real-time security protocols have been designed. Such protocol needs to provide at least the following primary objectives &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>The parties can negotiate interactively to authenticate each other.</li> <li>Establish a secret session key before exchanging information on network.</li> <li>Exchange the information in encrypted form.</li> </ul> <p>Interestingly, these protocols work at different layers of networking model. For example, S/MIME protocol works at Application layer, SSL protocol is developed to work at transport layer, and IPsec protocol works at Network layer.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/application_layer.jpg\" alt=\"Application Layer\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>In this chapter, we will discuss different processes for achieving security for e-mail communication and associated security protocols. The method for securing DNS is covered subsequently. In the later chapters, the protocols to achieve web security will be described.</p> <h2>E-mail Security</h2> <p>Nowadays, e-mail has become very widely used network application. Let&rsquo;s briefly discuss the e-mail infrastructure before proceeding to know about e-mail security protocols.</p> <h3>E-mail Infrastructure</h3> <p>The simplest way of sending an e-mail would be sending a message directly from the sender&rsquo;s machine to the recipient&rsquo;s machine. In this case, it is essential for both the machines to be running on the network simultaneously. However, this setup is impractical as users may occasionally connect their machines to the network.</p> <p>Hence, the concept of setting up e-mail servers arrived. In this setup, the mail is sent to a mail server which is permanently available on the network. When the recipient&rsquo;s machine connects to the network, it reads the mail from the mail server.</p> <p>In general, the e-mail infrastructure consists of a mesh of mail servers, also termed as&nbsp;<strong>Message Transfer Agents</strong>&nbsp;(MTAs) and client machines running an e-mail program comprising of User Agent (UA) and local MTA.</p> <p>Typically, an e-mail message gets forwarded from its UA, goes through the mesh of MTAs and finally reaches the UA on the recipient&rsquo;s machine.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/email_infrastructure.jpg\" alt=\"E-mail Infrastructure\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <p>The protocols used for e-mail are as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Simple mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) used for forwarding e-mail messages.</p> </li> <li> <p>Post Office Protocol (POP) and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) are used to retrieve the messages by recipient from the server.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>MIME</h3> <p>Basic Internet e-mail standard was written in 1982 and it describes the format of e-mail message exchanged on the Internet. It mainly supports e-mail message written as text in basic Roman alphabet.</p> <p>By 1992, the need was felt to improve the same. Hence, an additional standard&nbsp;<em>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions</em>&nbsp;(MIME) was defined. It is a set of extensions to the basic Internet E-mail standard. MIME provides an ability to send e-mail using characters other than those of the basic Roman alphabet such as Cyrillic alphabet (used in Russian), the Greek alphabet, or even the ideographic characters of Chinese.</p> <p>Another need fulfilled by MIME is to send non-text contents, such as images or video clips. Due to this features, the MIME standard became widely adopted with SMTP for e-mail communication.</p> <h3>E-Mail Security Services</h3> <p>Growing use of e-mail communication for important and crucial transactions demands provision of certain fundamental security services as the following &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>&nbsp;&minus; E-mail message should not be read by anyone but the intended recipient.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Authentication</strong>&nbsp;&minus; E-mail recipient can be sure of the identity of the sender.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Integrity</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Assurance to the recipient that the e-mail message has not been altered since it was transmitted by the sender.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Non-repudiation</strong>&nbsp;&minus; E-mail recipient is able to prove to a third party that the sender really did send the message.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Proof of submission</strong>&nbsp;&minus; E-mail sender gets the confirmation that the message is handed to the mail delivery system.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Proof of delivery</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Sender gets a confirmation that the recipient received the message.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Security services such as privacy, authentication, message integrity, and non-repudiation are usually provided by using public key cryptography.</p> <p>Typically, there are three different scenarios of e-mail communication. We will discuss the methods of achieving above security services in these scenarios.</p> <h3>One-to-One E-mail</h3> <p>In this scenario, the sender sends an e-mail message to only one recipient. Usually, not more than two MTA are involved in the communication.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/one_to_one_email.jpg\" alt=\"One-to-One E-mail\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>Let&rsquo;s assume a sender wants to send a confidential e-mail to a recipient. The provision of privacy in this case is achieved as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The sender and receiver have their private-public keys as (S<sub>PVT</sub>, S<sub>PUB</sub>) and (R<sub>PVT</sub>, R<sub>PUB</sub>) respectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>The sender generates a secret symmetric key, K<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;for encryption. Though the sender could have used R<sub>PUB</sub>&nbsp;for encryption, a symmetric key is used to achieve faster encryption and decryption.</p> </li> <li> <p>The sender encrypts message with key K<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;and also encrypts K<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;with public key of the recipient, R<sub>PUB</sub>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The sender sends encrypted message and encrypted K<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;to the recipient.</p> </li> <li> <p>The recipient first obtains K<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;by decrypting encoded K<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;using his private key, R<sub>PVT</sub>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The recipient then decrypts message using the symmetric key, K<sub>S</sub>.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/confidential_email.jpg\" alt=\"Confidential E-mail\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>If message integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation services are also needed in this scenario, the following steps are added to the above process.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The sender produces hash of message and digitally signs this hash with his private key, S<sub>PVT</sub>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The sender sends this signed hash to the recipient along with other components.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/message_integrity_authentication_non_repudiation.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" alt=\"Message Integrity Authentication and Non-repudiation\" /></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The recipient uses public key S<sub>PUB</sub>&nbsp;and extracts the hash received under the sender&rsquo;s signature.</p> </li> <li> <p>The recipient then hashes the decrypted message and now compares the two hash values. If they match, message integrity is considered to be achieved.</p> </li> <li> <p>Also, the recipient is sure that the message is sent by the sender (authentication). And lastly, the sender cannot deny that he did not send the message (non-repudiation).</p> </li> </ul> <h3>One-to-Multiple Recipients E-mail</h3> <p>In this scenario, the sender sends an e-mail message to two or more recipients. The list is managed by the sender&rsquo;s e-mail program (UA + local MTA). All recipients get the same message.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/one_to_multiple_recipients_email.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" alt=\"One-to-Multiple Recipients E-mail\" /></p> <p>Let&rsquo;s assume, the sender wants to send confidential e-mail to many recipients (say R1, R2, and R3). The provision of privacy in this case is achieved as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The sender and all recipients have their own pair of private-public keys.</p> </li> <li> <p>The sender generates a secret symmetric key, K<sub>s</sub>&nbsp;and encrypts the message with this key.</p> </li> <li> <p>The sender then encrypts K<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;multiple times with public keys of R1, R2, and R3, getting R1<sub>PUB</sub>(K<sub>S</sub>), R2<sub>PUB</sub>(K<sub>S</sub>), and R3<sub>PUB</sub>(K<sub>S</sub>).</p> </li> <li> <p>The sender sends encrypted message and corresponding encrypted K<sub>S</sub>to the recipient. For example, recipient 1 (R1) receives encrypted message and R1<sub>PUB</sub>(K<sub>S</sub>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Each recipient first extracts key K<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;by decrypting encoded K<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;using his private key.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each recipient then decrypts the message using the symmetric key, K<sub>S</sub>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For providing the message integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation, the steps to be followed are similar to the steps mentioned above in one-to-one e-mail scenario.</p> <h3>One-to-Distribution List E-mail</h3> <p>In this scenario, the sender sends an e-mail message to two or more recipients but the list of recipients is not managed locally by the sender. Generally, the e-mail server (MTA) maintains the mailing list.</p> <p>The sender sends a mail to the MTA managing the mailing list and then the mail is exploded by MTA to all recipients in the list.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/one_to_distributed_list_email.jpg\" alt=\"One-to-Distribution List E-mail\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>In this case, when the sender wants to send a confidential e-mail to the recipients of the mailing list (say R1, R2, and R3); the privacy is ensured as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The sender and all recipients have their own pair of private-public keys. The Exploder Server has a pair of private-public key for each mailing list (List<sub>PUB</sub>, List<sub>PVT</sub>) maintained by it.</p> </li> <li> <p>The sender generates a secret symmetric key K<sub>s</sub>&nbsp;and then encrypts the message with this key.</p> </li> <li> <p>The sender then encrypts K<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;with the public key associated with the list, obtains List<sub>PUB</sub>(K<sub>S</sub>).</p> </li> <li> <p>The sender sends encrypted message and List<sub>PUB</sub>(K<sub>S</sub>). The exploder MTA decrypts List<sub>PUB</sub>(K<sub>S</sub>) using List<sub>PVT</sub>&nbsp;and obtains K<sub>S</sub>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The exploder encrypts K<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;with as many public keys as there are members in the list.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Exploder forwards the received encrypted message and corresponding encrypted K<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;to all recipients in the list. For example, the Exploder forwards the encrypted message and R1<sub>PUB</sub>(K<sub>S</sub>) to recipient 1 and so on.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/encrypted_message.jpg\" alt=\"Encrypted Message\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>For providing the message integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation the steps to be followed are similar as given in case of one-to-one e-mail scenario.</p> <p>Interestingly, the e-mail program employing above security method for securing e-mail is expected to work for all the possible scenarios discussed above. Most of the above security mechanisms for e-mail are provided by two popular schemes, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and S/MIME. We discuss both in the following sections.</p> <h2>PGP</h2> <p><strong>Pretty Good Privacy</strong>&nbsp;(PGP) is an e-mail encryption scheme. It has become the de-facto standard for providing security services for e-mail communication.</p> <p>As discussed above, it uses public key cryptography, symmetric key cryptography, hash function, and digital signature. It provides &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Privacy</li> <li>Sender Authentication</li> <li>Message Integrity</li> <li>Non-repudiation</li> </ul> <p>Along with these security services, it also provides data compression and key management support. PGP uses existing cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, IDEA, MD5, etc., rather than inventing the new ones.</p> <h3>Working of PGP</h3> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/working_of_pgp.jpg\" alt=\"Working of PGP\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Hash of the message is calculated. (MD5 algorithm)</p> </li> <li> <p>Resultant 128 bit hash is signed using the private key of the sender (RSA Algorithm).</p> </li> <li> <p>The digital signature is concatenated to message, and the result is compressed.</p> </li> <li> <p>A 128-bit symmetric key, K<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;is generated and used to encrypt the compressed message with IDEA.</p> </li> <li> <p>K<sub>S</sub>&nbsp;is encrypted using the public key of the recipient using RSA algorithm and the result is appended to the encrypted message.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The format of PGP message is shown in the following diagram. The IDs indicate which key is used to encrypt KS and which key is to be used to verify the signature on the hash.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/pgp_message_format.jpg\" alt=\"PGP Message Format\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>In PGP scheme, a message in signed and encrypted, and then MIME is encoded before transmission.</p> <h3>PGP Certificate</h3> <p>PGP key certificate is normally established through a chain of trust. For example, A&rsquo;s public key is signed by B using his public key and B&rsquo;s public key is signed by C using his public key. As this process goes on, it establishes a web of trust.</p> <p>In a PGP environment, any user can act as a certifying authority. Any PGP user can certify another PGP user's public key. However, such a certificate is only valid to another user if the user recognizes the certifier as a trusted introducer.</p> <p>Several issues exist with such a certification method. It may be difficult to find a chain leading from a known and trusted public key to desired key. Also, there might be multiple chains which can lead to different keys for desired user.</p> <p>PGP can also use the PKI infrastructure with certification authority and public keys can be certified by CA (X.509 certificate).</p> <h2>S / MIME</h2> <p>S/MIME stands for Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension. S/MIME is a secure e-mail standard. It is based on an earlier non-secure e-mailing standard called MIME.</p> <h3>Working of S/MIME</h3> <p>S/MIME approach is similar to PGP. It also uses public key cryptography, symmetric key cryptography, hash functions, and digital signatures. It provides similar security services as PGP for e-mail communication.</p> <p>The most common symmetric ciphers used in S/MIME are RC2 and TripleDES. The usual public key method is RSA, and the hashing algorithm is SHA-1 or MD5.</p> <p>S/MIME specifies the additional MIME type, such as &ldquo;application/pkcs7-mime&rdquo;, for data enveloping after encrypting. The whole MIME entity is encrypted and packed into an object. S/MIME has standardized cryptographic message formats (different from PGP). In fact, MIME is extended with some keywords to identify the encrypted and/or signed parts in the message.</p> <p>S/MIME relies on X.509 certificates for public key distribution. It needs top-down hierarchical PKI for certification support.</p> <h3>Employability of S/MIME</h3> <p>Due to the requirement of a certificate from certification authority for implementation, not all users can take advantage of S/MIME, as some may wish to encrypt a message, with a public/private key pair. For example, without the involvement or administrative overhead of certificates.</p> <p>In practice, although most e-mailing applications implement S/MIME, the certificate enrollment process is complex. Instead PGP support usually requires adding a plug-in and that plug-in comes with all that is needed to manage keys. The Web of Trust is not really used. People exchange their public keys over another medium. Once obtained, they keep a copy of public keys of those with whom e-mails are usually exchanged.</p> <p>Implementation layer in network architecture for PGP and S/MIME schemes is shown in the following image. Both these schemes provide application level security of for e-mail communication.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/employability_of_s_mime.jpg\" alt=\"Employability of S/MIME\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>One of the schemes, either PGP or S/MIME, is used depending on the environment. A secure e-email communication in a captive network can be provided by adapting to PGP. For e-mail security over Internet, where mails are exchanged with new unknown users very often, S/MIME is considered as a good option.</p> <h2>DNS Security</h2> <p>In the first chapter, we have mentioned that an attacker can use DNS Cache Poisoning to carry out an attack on the target user.&nbsp;<strong>Domain Name System Security Extensions</strong>&nbsp;(DNSSEC) is an Internet standard that can foil such attacks.</p> <h3>Vulnerability of Standard DNS</h3> <p>In a standard DNS scheme, whenever the user wants to connect to any domain name, his computer contacts the DNS server and looks up the associated IP address for that domain name. Once IP address is obtained, the computer then connects to that IP address.</p> <p>In this scheme, there is no verification process involved at all. A computer asks its DNS server for the address associated with a website, the DNS server responds with an IP address, and your computer undoubtedly accepts it as legitimate response and connects to that website.</p> <p>A DNS lookup actually happens in several stages. For example, when a computer asks for &ldquo;www.tutorialspoint.com&rdquo;, a DNS lookup is performed in several stages &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The computer first asks the local DNS server (ISP provided). If ISP has this name in its cache, it responds else forwards the query to &ldquo;root zone directory&rdquo; where it can find &ldquo;.com.&rdquo; and root zone replies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Based on the reply, the computer then asks the &ldquo;.com&rdquo; directory where it can find &ldquo;tutorialspoint.com.&rdquo;</p> </li> <li> <p>Based on the information received, the computer inquires &ldquo;tutorialspoint.com&rdquo; where it can find www. tutorialspoint.com.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/standard_dns_vulnerability.jpg\" alt=\"Standard DNS Vulnerability\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h3>DNSSEC Defined</h3> <p>DNS lookup, when performed using DNSSEC, involves signing of replies by the responding entity. DNSSEC is based on public-key cryptography.</p> <p>In DNSSEC standard, every DNS zone has a public/private key pair. All information sent by a DNS server is signed with the originating zone&rsquo;s private key for ensuring authenticity. DNS clients need to know the zone&rsquo;s public keys to check the signatures. Clients may be preconfigured with the public keys of all the top-level domains, or root DNS.</p> <p>With DNSSEC, the lookup process goes as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>When your computer goes to ask the root zone where it can find .com, the reply is signed by the root zone server.</p> </li> <li> <p>Computer checks the root zone&rsquo;s signing key and confirms that it is the legitimate root zone with true information.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the reply, the root zone provides the information on the signing key of .com zone server and its location, allowing the computer to contact the .com directory and ensuring it is legitimate.</p> </li> <li> <p>The .com directory then provides the signing key and information for tutorialspoint.com, allowing it to contact google.com and verify that you are connected to the real tutorialspoint.com, as confirmed by the zones above it.</p> </li> <li> <p>The information sent is in the form of Resource Record Set (RRSets). The example of RRSet for domain &ldquo;tutorialspoint.com&rdquo; in top-level &ldquo;.com&rdquo; server is shown in the following table.</p> </li> </ul> <table class=\"table table-bordered\"> <tbody> <tr> <th>Domain Name</th> <th>Time to live</th> <th>Type</th> <th>Value</th> </tr> <tr> <td>tutorialspoint.com</td> <td>86400</td> <td>NS</td> <td>dns.tutorialspoint.com</td> </tr> <tr> <td>dns.tutorialspoint.com</td> <td>86400</td> <td>A</td> <td>36..1.2.3</td> </tr> <tr> <td>tutorialspoint.com</td> <td>86400</td> <td>KEY</td> <td>3682793A7B73F731029CE2737D...</td> </tr> <tr> <td>tutorialspoint.com</td> <td>86400</td> <td>SIG</td> <td>86947503A8B848F5272E53930C...</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The KEY record is a public key of &ldquo;tutorialspoint.com&rdquo;.</p> </li> <li> <p>The SIG record is the top-level .com server's signed hash of the fields NS, A, and KEY records to verify their authenticity. Its value is Kcom<sub>pvt</sub>(H(NS,A,KEY)).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Thus, it is considered that when DNSSEC is fully rolled out, the user&rsquo;s computer is able to confirm that DNS responses are legitimate and true, and avoid DNS attacks launched through DNS cache poisoning.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>The process of securing e-mails ensures the end-to-end security of the communication. It provides security services of confidentiality, sender authentication, message integrity, and non-repudiation.</p> <p>Two schemes have been developed for e-mail security: PGP and S/MIME. Both these schemes use secret-key and public-key cryptography.</p> <p>Standard DNS lookup is vulnerable to the attacks such as DNS spoofing/cache poisoning. Securing DNS lookup is feasible through the use of DNSSEC which employs the public-key cryptography.</p> <p>In this chapter, we discussed the mechanisms used at application layer to provide network security for end-to-end communication.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

            "<h1>Network Security &ndash; Transport Layer</h1> <p>Network security entails securing data against attacks while it is in transit on a network. To achieve this goal, many real-time security protocols have been designed. There are popular standards for real-time network security protocols such as S/MIME, SSL/TLS, SSH, and IPsec. As mentioned earlier, these protocols work at different layers of networking model.</p> <p>In the last chapter, we discussed some popular protocols that are designed to provide application layer security. In this chapter, we will discuss the process of achieving network security at Transport Layer and associated security protocols.</p> <p>For TCP/IP protocol based network, physical and data link layers are typically implemented in the user terminal and network card hardware. TCP and IP layers are implemented in the operating system. Anything above TCP/IP is implemented as user process.</p> <h2>Need for Transport Layer Security</h2> <p>Let's discuss a typical Internet-based business transaction.</p> <p>Bob visits Alice&rsquo;s website for selling goods. In a form on the website, Bob enters the type of good and quantity desired, his address and payment card details. Bob clicks on Submit and waits for delivery of goods with debit of price amount from his account. All this sounds good, but in absence of network security, Bob could be in for a few surprises.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>If transactions did not use confidentiality (encryption), an attacker could obtain his payment card information. The attacker can then make purchases at Bob's expense.</p> </li> <li> <p>If no data integrity measure is used, an attacker could modify Bob's order in terms of type or quantity of goods.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lastly, if no server authentication is used, a server could display Alice's famous logo but the site could be a malicious site maintained by an attacker, who is masquerading as Alice. After receiving Bob's order, he could take Bob's money and flee. Or he could carry out an identity theft by collecting Bob's name and credit card details.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Transport layer security schemes can address these problems by enhancing TCP/IP based network communication with confidentiality, data integrity, server authentication, and client authentication.</p> <p>The security at this layer is mostly used to secure HTTP based web transactions on a network. However, it can be employed by any application running over TCP.</p> <h3>Philosophy of TLS Design</h3> <p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols operate above the TCP layer. Design of these protocols use popular Application Program Interfaces (API) to TCP, called &ldquo;sockets\" for interfacing with TCP layer.</p> <p>Applications are now interfaced to Transport Security Layer instead of TCP directly. Transport Security Layer provides a simple API with sockets, which is similar and analogous to TCP's API.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/philosophy_of_tls_design.jpg\" alt=\"Philosophy of TLS Design\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>In the above diagram, although TLS technically resides between application and transport layer, from the common perspective it is a transport protocol that acts as TCP layer enhanced with security services.</p> <p>TLS is designed to operate over TCP, the reliable layer 4 protocol (not on UDP protocol), to make design of TLS much simpler, because it doesn't have to worry about &lsquo;timing out&rsquo; and &lsquo;retransmitting lost data&rsquo;. The TCP layer continues doing that as usual which serves the need of TLS.</p> <h3>Why TLS is Popular?</h3> <p>The reason for popularity of using a security at Transport Layer is simplicity. Design and deployment of security at this layer does not require any change in TCP/IP protocols that are implemented in an operating system. Only user processes and applications needs to be designed/modified which is less complex.</p> <h2>Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</h2> <p>In this section, we discuss the family of protocols designed for TLS. The family includes SSL versions 2 and 3 and TLS protocol. SSLv2 has been now replaced by SSLv3, so we will focus on SSL v3 and TLS.</p> <h3>Brief History of SSL</h3> <p>In year 1995, Netscape developed SSLv2 and used in Netscape Navigator 1.1. The SSL version1 was never published and used. Later, Microsoft improved upon SSLv2 and introduced another similar protocol named Private Communications Technology (PCT).</p> <p>Netscape substantially improved SSLv2 on various security issues and deployed SSLv3 in 1999. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) subsequently, introduced a similar TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol as an open standard. TLS protocol is non-interoperable with SSLv3.</p> <p>TLS modified the cryptographic algorithms for key expansion and authentication. Also, TLS suggested use of open crypto Diffie-Hellman (DH) and Digital Signature Standard (DSS) in place of patented RSA crypto used in SSL. But due to expiry of RSA patent in 2000, there existed no strong reasons for users to shift away from the widely deployed SSLv3 to TLS.</p> <h3>Salient Features of SSL</h3> <p>The salient features of SSL protocol are as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>SSL provides network connection security through &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Information is exchanged in an encrypted form.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Authentication</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Communication entities identify each other through the use of digital certificates. Web-server authentication is mandatory whereas client authentication is kept optional.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Reliability</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Maintains message integrity checks.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>SSL is available for all TCP applications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Supported by almost all web browsers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Provides ease in doing business with new online entities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Developed primarily for Web e-commerce.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Architecture of SSL</h3> <p>SSL is specific to TCP and it does not work with UDP. SSL provides Application Programming Interface (API) to applications. C and Java SSL libraries/classes are readily available.</p> <p>SSL protocol is designed to interwork between application and transport layer as shown in the following image &minus;</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/ssl_architecture.jpg\" alt=\"SSL Architecture\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>SSL itself is not a single layer protocol as depicted in the image; in fact it is composed of two sub-layers.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Lower sub-layer comprises of the one component of SSL protocol called as SSL Record Protocol. This component provides integrity and confidentiality services.</p> </li> <li> <p>Upper sub-layer comprises of three SSL-related protocol components and an application protocol. Application component provides the information transfer service between client/server interactions. Technically, it can operate on top of SSL layer as well. Three SSL related protocol components are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>SSL Handshake Protocol</li> <li>Change Cipher Spec Protocol</li> <li>Alert Protocol.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>These three protocols manage all of SSL message exchanges and are discussed later in this section.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/ssl_protocol_architecture.jpg\" alt=\"SSL Protocol Architecture\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <h3>Functions of SSL Protocol Components</h3> <p>The four sub-components of the SSL protocol handle various tasks for secure communication between the client machine and the server.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Record Protocol</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The record layer formats the upper layer protocol messages.</p> </li> <li> <p>It fragments the data into manageable blocks (max length 16 KB). It optionally compresses the data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Encrypts the data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Provides a header for each message and a hash (Message Authentication Code (MAC)) at the end.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hands over the formatted blocks to TCP layer for transmission.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/ssl_protocol_functions.jpg\" alt=\"SSL Protocol Functions\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>SSL Handshake Protocol</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>It is the most complex part of SSL. It is invoked before any application data is transmitted. It creates SSL sessions between the client and the server.</p> </li> <li> <p>Establishment of session involves Server authentication, Key and algorithm negotiation, Establishing keys and Client authentication (optional).</p> </li> <li> <p>A session is identified by unique set of cryptographic security parameters.</p> </li> <li> <p>Multiple secure TCP connections between a client and a server can share the same session.</p> </li> <li> <p>Handshake protocol actions through four phases. These are discussed in the next section.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>ChangeCipherSpec Protocol</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Simplest part of SSL protocol. It comprises of a single message exchanged between two communicating entities, the client and the server.</p> </li> <li> <p>As each entity sends the ChangeCipherSpec message, it changes its side of the connection into the secure state as agreed upon.</p> </li> <li> <p>The cipher parameters pending state is copied into the current state.</p> </li> <li> <p>Exchange of this Message indicates all future data exchanges are encrypted and integrity is protected.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>SSL Alert Protocol</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>This protocol is used to report errors &ndash; such as unexpected message, bad record MAC, security parameters negotiation failed, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is also used for other purposes &ndash; such as notify closure of the TCP connection, notify receipt of bad or unknown certificate, etc.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3>Establishment of SSL Session</h3> <p>As discussed above, there are four phases of SSL session establishment. These are mainly handled by SSL Handshake protocol.</p> <p><strong>Phase 1</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Establishing security capabilities.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>This phase comprises of exchange of two messages &ndash;&nbsp;<em>Client_hello</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Server_hello</em>.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/ssl_session_establishment_phase1.jpg\" alt=\"SSL Session Establishment Phase1\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><em>Client_hello</em>&nbsp;contains of list of cryptographic algorithms supported by the client, in decreasing order of preference.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Server_hello</em>&nbsp;contains the selected Cipher Specification (CipherSpec) and a new&nbsp;<em>session_id</em>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The CipherSpec contains fields like &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Cipher Algorithm (DES, 3DES, RC2, and RC4)</p> </li> <li> <p>MAC Algorithm (based on MD5, SHA-1)</p> </li> <li> <p>Public-key algorithm (RSA)</p> </li> <li> <p>Both messages have &ldquo;nonce&rdquo; to prevent replay attack.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Phase 2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Server authentication and key exchange.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/ssl_session_establishment_phase2.jpg\" alt=\"SSL Session Establishment Phase2\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Server sends certificate. Client software comes configured with public keys of various &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; organizations (CAs) to check certificate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Server sends chosen cipher suite.</p> </li> <li> <p>Server may request client certificate. Usually it is not done.</p> </li> <li> <p>Server indicates end of&nbsp;<em>Server_hello</em>.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Phase 3</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Client authentication and key exchange.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/ssl_session_establishment_phase3.jpg\" alt=\"SSL Session Establishment Phase3\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Client sends certificate, only if requested by the server.</p> </li> <li> <p>It also sends the Pre-master Secret (PMS) encrypted with the server&rsquo;s public key.</p> </li> <li> <p>Client also sends&nbsp;<em>Certificate_verify</em>&nbsp;message if certificate is sent by him to prove he has the private key associated with this certificate. Basically, the client signs a hash of the previous messages.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Phase 4</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Finish.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/ssl_session_establishment_phase4.jpg\" alt=\"SSL Session Establishment Phase4\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Client and server send&nbsp;<em>Change_cipher_spec</em>&nbsp;messages to each other to cause the pending cipher state to be copied into the current state.</p> </li> <li> <p>From now on, all data is encrypted and integrity protected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Message &ldquo;Finished&rdquo; from each end verifies that the key exchange and authentication processes were successful.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All four phases, discussed above, happen within the establishment of TCP session. SSL session establishment starts after TCP SYN/ SYNACK and finishes before TCP Fin.</p> <h3>Resuming a Disconnected Session</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>It is possible to resume a disconnected session (through&nbsp;<em>Alert</em>message), if the client sends a&nbsp;<em>hello_request</em>&nbsp;to the server with the encrypted&nbsp;<em>session_id</em>&nbsp;information.</p> </li> <li> <p>The server then determines if the&nbsp;<em>session_id</em>&nbsp;is valid. If validated, it exchanges ChangeCipherSpec and&nbsp;<em>finished</em>&nbsp;messages with the client and secure communications resume.</p> </li> <li> <p>This avoids recalculating of session cipher parameters and saves computing at the server and the client end.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>SSL Session Keys</h3> <p>We have seen that during Phase 3 of SSL session establishment, a pre-master secret is sent by the client to the server encrypted using server&rsquo;s public key. The master secret and various session keys are generated as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The master secret is generated (via pseudo random number generator) using &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The pre-master secret.</p> </li> <li> <p>Two nonces (RA and RB) exchanged in the client_hello and server_hello messages.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Six secret values are then derived from this master secret as &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Secret key used with MAC (for data sent by server)</p> </li> <li> <p>Secret key used with MAC (for data sent by client)</p> </li> <li> <p>Secret key and IV used for encryption (by server)</p> </li> <li> <p>Secret key and IV used for encryption (by client)</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>TLS Protocol</h2> <p>In order to provide an open Internet standard of SSL, IETF released The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol in January 1999. TLS is defined as a proposed Internet Standard in RFC 5246.</p> <h3>Salient Features</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>TLS protocol has same objectives as SSL.</p> </li> <li> <p>It enables client/server applications to communicate in a secure manner by authenticating, preventing eavesdropping and resisting message modification.</p> </li> <li> <p>TLS protocol sits above the reliable connection-oriented transport TCP layer in the networking layers stack.</p> </li> <li> <p>The architecture of TLS protocol is similar to SSLv3 protocol. It has two sub protocols: the TLS Record protocol and the TLS Handshake protocol.</p> </li> <li> <p>Though SSLv3 and TLS protocol have similar architecture, several changes were made in architecture and functioning particularly for the handshake protocol.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Comparison of TLS and SSL Protocols</h3> <p>There are main eight differences between TLS and SSLv3 protocols. These are as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Protocol Version</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The header of TLS protocol segment carries the version number 3.1 to differentiate between number 3 carried by SSL protocol segment header.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Message Authentication</strong>&nbsp;&minus; TLS employs a keyed-hash message authentication code (H-MAC). Benefit is that H-MAC operates with any hash function, not just MD5 or SHA, as explicitly stated by the SSL protocol.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Session Key Generation</strong>&nbsp;&minus; There are two differences between TLS and SSL protocol for generation of key material.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Method of computing pre-master and master secrets is similar. But in TLS protocol, computation of master secret uses the HMAC standard and pseudorandom function (PRF) output instead of ad-hoc MAC.</p> </li> <li> <p>The algorithm for computing session keys and initiation values (IV) is different in TLS than SSL protocol.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Alert Protocol Message &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>TLS protocol supports all the messages used by the Alert protocol of SSL, except&nbsp;<em>No certificate</em>&nbsp;alert message being made redundant. The client sends empty certificate in case client authentication is not required.</p> </li> <li> <p>Many additional Alert messages are included in TLS protocol for other error conditions such as&nbsp;<em>record_overflow, decode_error</em>&nbsp;etc.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Supported Cipher Suites</strong>&nbsp;&minus; SSL supports RSA, Diffie-Hellman and Fortezza cipher suites. TLS protocol supports all suits except Fortezza.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Client Certificate Types</strong>&nbsp;&minus; TLS defines certificate types to be requested in a&nbsp;<em>certificate_request</em>&nbsp;message. SSLv3 support all of these. Additionally, SSL support certain other types of certificate such as Fortezza.</p> </li> <li> <p>CertificateVerify and Finished Messages &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>In SSL, complex message procedure is used for the&nbsp;<em>certificate_verify</em>&nbsp;message. With TLS, the verified information is contained in the handshake messages itself thus avoiding this complex procedure.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finished message is computed in different manners in TLS and SSLv3.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Padding of Data</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In SSL protocol, the padding added to user data before encryption is the minimum amount required to make the total data-size equal to a multiple of the cipher&rsquo;s block length. In TLS, the padding can be any amount that results in data-size that is a multiple of the cipher&rsquo;s block length, up to a maximum of 255 bytes.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The above differences between TLS and SSLv3 protocols are summarized in the following table.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/tls_vs_sslv3.jpg\" alt=\"TLS Vs SSLv3\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Secure Browsing - HTTPS</h2> <p>In this section, we will discuss the use of SSL/TLS protocol for performing secure web browsing.</p> <h3>HTTPS Defined</h3> <p>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) protocol is used for web browsing. The function of HTTPS is similar to HTTP. The only difference is that HTTPS provides &ldquo;secure&rdquo; web browsing. HTTPS stands for HTTP over SSL. This protocol is used to provide the encrypted and authenticated connection between the client web browser and the website server.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/https_defined.jpg\" alt=\"HTTPS Defined\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>The secure browsing through HTTPS ensures that the following content are encrypted &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>URL of the requested web page.</li> <li>Web page contents provided by the server to the user client.</li> <li>Contents of forms filled in by user.</li> <li>Cookies established in both directions.</li> </ul> <h3>Working of HTTPS</h3> <p>HTTPS application protocol typically uses one of two popular transport layer security protocols - SSL or TLS. The process of secure browsing is described in the following points.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>You request a HTTPS connection to a webpage by entering https:// followed by URL in the browser address bar.</p> </li> <li> <p>Web browser initiates a connection to the web server. Use of https invokes the use of SSL protocol.</p> </li> <li> <p>An application, browser in this case, uses the system port 443 instead of port 80 (used in case of http).</p> </li> <li> <p>The SSL protocol goes through a handshake protocol for establishing a secure session as discussed in earlier sections.</p> </li> <li> <p>The website initially sends its SSL Digital certificate to your browser. On verification of certificate, the SSL handshake progresses to exchange the shared secrets for the session.</p> </li> <li> <p>When a trusted SSL Digital Certificate is used by the server, users get to see a padlock icon in the browser address bar. When an Extended Validation Certificate is installed on a website, the address bar turns green.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/https_working.jpg\" alt=\"HTTPS Working\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Once established, this session consists of many secure connections between the web server and the browser.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Use of HTTPS</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Use of HTTPS provides confidentiality, server authentication and message integrity to the user. It enables safe conduct of e-commerce on the Internet.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prevents data from eavesdropping and denies identity theft which are common attacks on HTTP.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Present day web browsers and web servers are equipped with HTTPS support. The use of HTTPS over HTTP, however, requires more computing power at the client and the server end to carry out encryption and SSL handshake.</p> <h2>Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)</h2> <p>The salient features of SSH are as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>SSH is a network protocol that runs on top of the TCP/IP layer. It is designed to replace the TELNET which provided unsecure means of remote logon facility.</p> </li> <li> <p>SSH provides a secure client/server communication and can be used for tasks such as file transfer and e-mail.</p> </li> <li> <p>SSH2 is a prevalent protocol which provides improved network communication security over earlier version SSH1.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>SSH Defined</h3> <p>SSH is organized as three sub-protocols.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/ssh_defined.jpg\" alt=\"SSH Defined\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Transport Layer Protocol</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This part of SSH protocol provides data confidentiality, server (host) authentication, and data integrity. It may optionally provide data compression as well.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Server Authentication</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Host keys are asymmetric like public/private keys. A server uses a public key to prove its identity to a client. The client verifies that contacted server is a &ldquo;known&rdquo; host from the database it maintains. Once the server is authenticated, session keys are generated.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Session Key Establishment</strong>&nbsp;&minus; After authentication, the server and the client agree upon cipher to be used. Session keys are generated by both the client and the server. Session keys are generated before user authentication so that usernames and passwords can be sent encrypted. These keys are generally replaced at regular intervals (say, every hour) during the session and are destroyed immediately after use.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Data Integrity</strong>&nbsp;&minus; SSH uses Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms to for data integrity check. It is an improvement over 32 bit CRC used by SSH1.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>User Authentication Protocol</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This part of SSH authenticates the user to the server. The server verifies that access is given to intended users only. Many authentication methods are currently used such as, typed passwords, Kerberos, public-key authentication, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Connection Protocol</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This provides multiple logical channels over a single underlying SSH connection.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>SSH Services</h3> <p>SSH provides three main services that enable provision of many secure solutions. These services are briefly described as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Secure Command-Shell (Remote Logon)</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It allows the user to edit files, view the contents of directories, and access applications on connected device. Systems administrators can remotely start/view/stop services and processes, create user accounts, and change file/directories permissions and so on. All tasks that are feasible at a machine&rsquo;s command prompt can now be performed securely from the remote machine using secure remote logon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Secure File Transfer</strong>&nbsp;&minus; SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is designed as an extension for SSH-2 for secure file transfer. In essence, it is a separate protocol layered over the Secure Shell protocol to handle file transfers. SFTP encrypts both the username/password and the file data being transferred. It uses the same port as the Secure Shell server, i.e. system port no 22.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Port Forwarding (Tunneling)</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It allows data from unsecured TCP/IP based applications to be secured. After port forwarding has been set up, Secure Shell reroutes traffic from a program (usually a client) and sends it across the encrypted tunnel to the program on the other side (usually a server). Multiple applications can transmit data over a single multiplexed secure channel, eliminating the need to open many ports on a firewall or router.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/ssh_services.jpg\" alt=\"SSH Services\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <h2>Benefits &amp; Limitations</h2> <p>The benefits and limitations of employing communication security at transport layer are as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Benefits</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Transport Layer Security is transparent to applications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Server is authenticated.</p> </li> <li> <p>Application layer headers are hidden.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is more fine-grained than security mechanisms at layer 3 (IPsec) as it works at the transport connection level.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Limitations</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Applicable to TCP-based applications only (not UDP).</p> </li> <li> <p>TCP/IP headers are in clear.</p> </li> <li> <p>Suitable for direct communication between the client and the server. Does not cater for secure applications using chain of servers (e.g. email)</p> </li> <li> <p>SSL does not provide non-repudiation as client authentication is optional.</p> </li> <li> <p>If needed, client authentication needs to be implemented above SSL.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>A large number of web applications have emerged on the Internet in the past decade. Many e-Governance and e-Commerce portal have come online. These applications require that session between the server and the client is secure providing confidentiality, authentication and integrity of sessions.</p> <p>One way of mitigating a potential attack during a user&rsquo;s session is to use a secure communication protocol. Two of such communication protocols, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), are discussed in this chapter. Both of these protocol function at Transport layer.</p> <p>Another transport layer protocol, Secure Shell (SSH), designed to replace the TELNET, provides secure means of remote logon facility. It is capable of providing various services such as Secure Command Shell and SFTP.</p> <p>Employment of Transport layer security has many benefits. However, the security protocol designed at these layer can be used with TCP only. They do not provide security for communication implemented using UDP.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

            "<h1>Network Security &ndash; Network Layer</h1> <p>Network layer security controls have been used frequently for securing communications, particularly over shared networks such as the Internet because they can provide protection for many applications at once without modifying them.</p> <p>In the earlier chapters, we discussed that many real-time security protocols have evolved for network security ensuring basic tenets of security such as privacy, origin authentication, message integrity, and non-repudiation.</p> <p>Most of these protocols remained focused at the higher layers of the OSI protocol stack, to compensate for inherent lack of security in standard Internet Protocol. Though valuable, these methods cannot be generalized easily for use with any application. For example, SSL is developed specifically to secure applications like HTTP or FTP. But there are several other applications which also need secure communications.</p> <p>This need gave rise to develop a security solution at the IP layer so that all higher-layer protocols could take advantage of it. In 1992, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) began to define a standard &lsquo;IPsec&rsquo;.</p> <p>In this chapter, we will discuss how security is achieved at network layer using this very popular set of protocol IPsec.</p> <h2>Security in Network Layer</h2> <p>Any scheme that is developed for providing network security needs to be implemented at some layer in protocol stack as depicted in the diagram below &minus;</p> <table class=\"table table-bordered\"> <tbody> <tr> <th>Layer</th> <th>Communication Protocols</th> <th>Security Protocols</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Application Layer</td> <td>HTTP FTP SMTP</td> <td>PGP. S/MIME, HTTPS</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Transport Layer</td> <td>TCP /UDP</td> <td>SSL, TLS, SSH</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Network Layer</td> <td>IP</td> <td>IPsec</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The popular framework developed for ensuring security at network layer is Internet Protocol Security (IPsec).</p> <h3>Features of IPsec</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>IPsec is not designed to work only with TCP as a transport protocol. It works with UDP as well as any other protocol above IP such as ICMP, OSPF etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>IPsec protects the entire packet presented to IP layer including higher layer headers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Since higher layer headers are hidden which carry port number, traffic analysis is more difficult.</p> </li> <li> <p>IPsec works from one network entity to another network entity, not from application process to application process. Hence, security can be adopted without requiring changes to individual user computers/applications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tough widely used to provide secure communication between network entities, IPsec can provide host-to-host security as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>The most common use of IPsec is to provide a Virtual Private Network (VPN), either between two locations (gateway-to-gateway) or between a remote user and an enterprise network (host-to-gateway).</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Security Functions</h3> <p>The important security functions provided by the IPsec are as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Confidentiality</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Enables communicating nodes to encrypt messages.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prevents eavesdropping by third parties.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Origin authentication and data integrity.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Provides assurance that a received packet was actually transmitted by the party identified as the source in the packet header.</p> </li> <li> <p>Confirms that the packet has not been altered or otherwise.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Key management.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Allows secure exchange of keys.</p> </li> <li> <p>Protection against certain types of security attacks, such as replay attacks.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3>Virtual Private Network</h3> <p>Ideally, any institution would want its own private network for communication to ensure security. However, it may be very costly to establish and maintain such private network over geographically dispersed area. It would require to manage complex infrastructure of communication links, routers, DNS, etc.</p> <p>IPsec provides an easy mechanism for implementing Virtual Private Network (VPN) for such institutions. VPN technology allows institution&rsquo;s inter-office traffic to be sent over public Internet by encrypting traffic before entering the public Internet and logically separating it from other traffic. The simplified working of VPN is shown in the following diagram &minus;</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/virtual_private_network.jpg\" alt=\"Virtual Private Network\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <h2>Overview of IPsec</h2> <p>IPsec is a framework/suite of protocols for providing security at the IP layer.</p> <h3>Origin</h3> <p>In early 1990s, Internet was used by few institutions, mostly for academic purposes. But in later decades, the growth of Internet became exponential due to expansion of network and several organizations using it for communication and other purposes.</p> <p>With the massive growth of Internet, combined with the inherent security weaknesses of the TCP/IP protocol, the need was felt for a technology that can provide network security on the Internet. A report entitled \"Security in the Internet Architecture&rdquo; was issued by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) in 1994. It identified the key areas for security mechanisms.</p> <p>The IAB included authentication and encryption as essential security features in the IPv6, the next-generation IP. Fortunately, these security capabilities were defined such that they can be implemented with both the current IPv4 and futuristic IPv6.</p> <p>Security framework, IPsec has been defined in several &lsquo;Requests for comments&rsquo; (RFCs). Some RFCs specify some portions of the protocol, while others address the solution as a whole.</p> <h3>Operations Within IPsec</h3> <p>The IPsec suite can be considered to have two separate operations, when performed in unison, providing a complete set of security services. These two operations are IPsec Communication and Internet Key Exchange.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>IPsec Communication</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>It is typically associated with standard IPsec functionality. It involves encapsulation, encryption, and hashing the IP datagrams and handling all packet processes.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is responsible for managing the communication according to the available Security Associations (SAs) established between communicating parties.</p> </li> <li> <p>It uses security protocols such as Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulated SP (ESP).</p> </li> <li> <p>IPsec communication is not involved in the creation of keys or their management.</p> </li> <li> <p>IPsec communication operation itself is commonly referred to as IPsec.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Internet Key Exchange (IKE)</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>IKE is the automatic key management protocol used for IPsec.</p> </li> <li> <p>Technically, key management is not essential for IPsec communication and the keys can be manually managed. However, manual key management is not desirable for large networks.</p> </li> <li> <p>IKE is responsible for creation of keys for IPsec and providing authentication during key establishment process. Though, IPsec can be used for any other key management protocols, IKE is used by default.</p> </li> <li> <p>IKE defines two protocol (Oakley and SKEME) to be used with already defined key management framework Internet Security Association Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP).</p> </li> <li> <p>ISAKMP is not IPsec specific, but provides the framework for creating SAs for any protocol.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>This chapter mainly discusses the IPsec communication and associated protocol employed to achieve security.</p> <h2>IPsec Communication Modes</h2> <p>IPsec Communication has two modes of functioning; transport and tunnel modes. These modes can be used in combination or used individually depending upon the type of communication desired.</p> <h3>Transport Mode</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>IPsec does not encapsulate a packet received from upper layer.</p> </li> <li> <p>The original IP header is maintained and the data is forwarded based on the original attributes set by the upper layer protocol.</p> </li> <li> <p>The following diagram shows the data flow in the protocol stack.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/transport_mode.jpg\" alt=\"Transport Mode\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The limitation of transport mode is that no gateway services can be provided. It is reserved for point-to-point communications as depicted in the following image.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/point_to_point_communications.jpg\" alt=\"Point-to-Point Communications\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <h3>Tunnel Mode</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>This mode of IPsec provides encapsulation services along with other security services.</p> </li> <li> <p>In tunnel mode operations, the entire packet from upper layer is encapsulated before applying security protocol. New IP header is added.</p> </li> <li> <p>The following diagram shows the data flow in the protocol stack.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/tunnel_mode.jpg\" alt=\"Tunnel Mode\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Tunnel mode is typically associated with gateway activities. The encapsulation provides the ability to send several sessions through a single gateway.</p> </li> <li> <p>The typical tunnel mode communication is as depicted in the following diagram.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/typical_tunnel_mode_communication.jpg\" alt=\"Typical Tunnel Mode Communication\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>As far as the endpoints are concerned, they have a direct transport layer connection. The datagram from one system forwarded to the gateway is encapsulated and then forwarded to the remote gateway. The remote associated gateway de-encapsulates the data and forwards it to the destination endpoint on the internal network.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using IPsec, the tunneling mode can be established between the gateway and individual end system as well.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/tunneling_mode_using_ipsec.jpg\" alt=\"Tunneling Mode Using IPsec\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <h2>IPsec Protocols</h2> <p>IPsec uses the security protocols to provide desired security services. These protocols are the heart of IPsec operations and everything else is designed to support these protocol in IPsec.</p> <p>Security associations between the communicating entities are established and maintained by the security protocol used.</p> <p>There are two security protocols defined by IPsec &mdash; Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).</p> <h3>Authentication Header</h3> <p>The AH protocol provides service of data integrity and origin authentication. It optionally caters for message replay resistance. However, it does not provide any form of confidentiality.</p> <p>AH is a protocol that provides authentication of either all or part of the contents of a datagram by the addition of a header. The header is calculated based on the values in the datagram. What parts of the datagram are used for the calculation, and where to place the header, depends on the mode cooperation (tunnel or transport).</p> <p>The operation of the AH protocol is surprisingly simple. It can be considered similar to the algorithms used to calculate checksums or perform CRC checks for error detection.</p> <p>The concept behind AH is the same, except that instead of using a simple algorithm, AH uses special hashing algorithm and a secret key known only to the communicating parties. A security association between two devices is set up that specifies these particulars.</p> <p>The process of AH goes through the following phases.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>When IP packet is received from upper protocol stack, IPsec determine the associated Security Association (SA) from available information in the packet; for example, IP address (source and destination).</p> </li> <li> <p>From SA, once it is identified that security protocol is AH, the parameters of AH header are calculated. The AH header consists of the following parameters &minus;</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/authentication_header.jpg\" alt=\"Authentication Header\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The header field specifies the protocol of packet following AH header. Sequence Parameter Index (SPI) is obtained from SA existing between communicating parties.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sequence Number is calculated and inserted. These numbers provide optional capability to AH to resist replay attack.</p> </li> <li> <p>Authentication data is calculated differently depending upon the communication mode.</p> </li> <li> <p>In transport mode, the calculation of authentication data and assembling of final IP packet for transmission is depicted in the following diagram. In original IP header, change is made only in protocol number as 51 to indicated application of AH.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/ip_packet_transmission1.jpg\" alt=\"Ip Packet Transmission1\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>In Tunnel mode, the above process takes place as depicted in the following diagram.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/ip_packet_transmission2.jpg\" alt=\"Ip Packet Transmission2\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <h3>Encapsulation Security Protocol (ESP)</h3> <p>ESP provides security services such as confidentiality, integrity, origin authentication, and optional replay resistance. The set of services provided depends on options selected at the time of Security Association (SA) establishment.</p> <p>In ESP, algorithms used for encryption and generating authenticator are determined by the attributes used to create the SA.</p> <p>The process of ESP is as follows. The first two steps are similar to process of AH as stated above.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Once it is determined that ESP is involved, the fields of ESP packet are calculated. The ESP field arrangement is depicted in the following diagram.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/esp_field_arrangement.jpg\" alt=\"ESP Field Arrangement\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Encryption and authentication process in transport mode is depicted in the following diagram.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/transport_mode_encryption_authentication.jpg\" alt=\"Transport Mode Encryption Authentication\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>In case of Tunnel mode, the encryption and authentication process is as depicted in the following diagram.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/tunnel_mode_encryption_authentication.jpg\" alt=\"Tunnel Mode Encryption Authentication\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>Although authentication and confidentiality are the primary services provided by ESP, both are optional. Technically, we can use NULL encryption without authentication. However, in practice, one of the two must be implemented to use ESP effectively.</p> <p>The basic concept is to use ESP when one wants authentication and encryption, and to use AH when one wants extended authentication without encryption.</p> <h2>Security Associations in IPsec</h2> <p>Security Association (SA) is the foundation of an IPsec communication. The features of SA are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Before sending data, a virtual connection is established between the sending entity and the receiving entity, called &ldquo;Security Association (SA)&rdquo;.</p> </li> <li> <p>IPsec provides many options for performing network encryption and authentication. Each IPsec connection can provide encryption, integrity, authenticity, or all three services. When the security service is determined, the two IPsec peer entities must determine exactly which algorithms to use (for example, DES or 3DES for encryption; MD5 or SHA-1 for integrity). After deciding on the algorithms, the two devices must share session keys.</p> </li> <li> <p>SA is a set of above communication parameters that provides a relationship between two or more systems to build an IPsec session.</p> </li> <li> <p>SA is simple in nature and hence two SAs are required for bi-directional communications.</p> </li> <li> <p>SAs are identified by a Security Parameter Index (SPI) number that exists in the security protocol header.</p> </li> <li> <p>Both sending and receiving entities maintain state information about the SA. It is similar to TCP endpoints which also maintain state information. IPsec is connection-oriented like TCP.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Parameters of SA</h3> <p>Any SA is uniquely identified by the following three parameters &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Security Parameters Index (SPI).</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>It is a 32-bit value assigned to SA. It is used to distinguish among different SAs terminating at the same destination and using the same IPsec protocol.</p> </li> <li> <p>Every packet of IPsec carries a header containing SPI field. The SPI is provided to map the incoming packet to an SA.</p> </li> <li> <p>The SPI is a random number generated by the sender to identify the SA to the recipient.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Destination IP Address</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It can be IP address of end router.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Security Protocol Identifier</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It indicates whether the association is an AH or ESP SA.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Example of SA between two router involved in IPsec communication is shown in the following diagram.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/sa_parameters.jpg\" alt=\"SA Parameters\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <h3>Security Administrative Databases</h3> <p>In IPsec, there are two databases that control the processing of IPsec datagram. One is the Security Association Database (SAD) and the other is the Security Policy Database (SPD). Each communicating endpoint using IPsec should have a logically separate SAD and SPD.</p> <h3>Security Association Database</h3> <p>In IPsec communication, endpoint holds SA state in Security Association Database (SAD). Each SA entry in SAD database contains nine parameters as shown in the following table &minus;</p> <table class=\"table table-bordered\"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.No.</th> <th>Parameters &amp; Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td> <p><strong>Sequence Number Counter</strong></p> <p>For outbound communications. This is the 32-bit sequence number provided in the AH or ESP headers.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td> <p><strong>Sequence Number Overflow Counter</strong></p> <p>Sets an option flag to prevent further communications utilizing the specific SA</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td> <p><strong>32-bit anti-replay window</strong></p> <p>Used to determine whether an inbound AH or ESP packet is a replay</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td> <p><strong>Lifetime of the SA</strong></p> <p>Time till SA remain active</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td> <p><strong>Algorithm - AH</strong></p> <p>Used in the AH and the associated key</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td> <p><strong>Algorithm - ESP Auth</strong></p> <p>Used in the authenticating portion of the ESP header</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td> <p><strong>Algorithm - ESP Encryption</strong></p> <p>Used in the encryption of the ESP and its associated key information</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td> <p><strong>IPsec mode of operation</strong></p> <p>Transport or tunnel mode</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>9</td> <td> <p><strong>Path MTU(PMTU)</strong></p> <p>Any observed path maximum transmission unit (to avoid fragmentation)</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>All SA entries in the SAD are indexed by the three SA parameters: Destination IP address, Security Protocol Identifier, and SPI.</p> <h3>Security Policy Database</h3> <p>SPD is used for processing outgoing packets. It helps in deciding what SAD entries should be used. If no SAD entry exists, SPD is used to create new ones.</p> <p>Any SPD entry would contain &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Pointer to active SA held in SAD.</p> </li> <li> <p>Selector fields &ndash; Field in incoming packet from upper layer used to decide application of IPsec. Selectors can include source and destination address, port numbers if relevant, application IDs, protocols, etc.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Outgoing IP datagrams go from the SPD entry to the specific SA, to get encoding parameters. Incoming IPsec datagram get to the correct SA directly using the SPI/DEST IP/Protocol triple, and from there extracts the associated SAD entry.</p> <p>SPD can also specify traffic that should bypass IPsec. SPD can be considered as a packet filter where the actions decided upon are the activation of SA processes.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>IPsec is a suite of protocols for securing network connections. It is rather a complex mechanism, because instead of giving straightforward definition of a specific encryption algorithm and authentication function, it provides a framework that allows an implementation of anything that both communicating ends agree upon.</p> <p>Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) are the two main communication protocols used by IPsec. While AH only authenticate, ESP can encrypt and authenticate the data transmitted over the connection.</p> <p>Transport Mode provides a secure connection between two endpoints without changing the IP header. Tunnel Mode encapsulates the entire payload IP packet. It adds new IP header. The latter is used to form a traditional VPN, as it provides a virtual secure tunnel across an untrusted Internet.</p> <p>Setting up an IPsec connection involves all kinds of crypto choices. Authentication is usually built on top of a cryptographic hash such as MD5 or SHA-1. Encryption algorithms are DES, 3DES, Blowfish, and AES being common. Other algorithms are possible too.</p> <p>Both communicating endpoints need to know the secret values used in hashing or encryption. Manual keys require manual entry of the secret values on both ends, presumably conveyed by some out-of-band mechanism, and IKE (Internet Key Exchange) is a sophisticated mechanism for doing this online.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

            "<h1>Network Security &ndash; Data Link Layer</h1> <p>We have seen that rapid growth of Internet has raised a major concern for network security. Several methods have been developed to provide security in the application, transport, or network layer of a network.</p> <p>Many organizations incorporate security measures at higher OSI layers, from application layer all the way down to IP layer. However, one area generally left unattended is hardening of Data Link layer. This can open the network to a variety of attacks and compromises.</p> <p>In this chapter, we will discuss security problems at Data Link Layer and methods to counter them. Our discussion will be focused on Ethernet network.</p> <h2>Security Concerns in Data Link Layer</h2> <p>Data link Layer in Ethernet networks is highly prone to several attacks. The most common attacks are &minus;</p> <h3>ARP Spoofing</h3> <p>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol used to map an IP address to a physical machine address recognizable in the local Ethernet. When a host machine needs to find a physical Media Access Control (MAC) address for an IP address, it broadcasts an ARP request. The other host that owns the IP address sends an ARP reply message with its physical address.</p> <p>Each host machine on network maintains a table, called &lsquo;ARP cache&rsquo;. The table holds the IP address and associated MAC addresses of other host on the network.</p> <p>Since ARP is a stateless protocol, every time a host gets an ARP reply from another host, even though it has not sent an ARP request, it accepts that ARP entry and updates its ARP cache. The process of modifying a target host&rsquo;s ARP cache with a forged entry known as ARP poisoning or ARP spoofing.</p> <p>ARP spoofing may allow an attacker to masquerade as legitimate host and then intercept data frames on a network, modify or stop them. Often the attack is used to launch other attacks such as man-in-the-middle, session hijacking, or denial of service.</p> <h1><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/arp_spoofing.jpg\" alt=\"ARP Spoofing\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></h1> <h3>MAC Flooding</h3> <p>Every switch in the Ethernet has a Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) table that stores the MAC addresses, switch port numbers, and other information. The table has a fixed size. In the MAC flooding attack, the attacker floods the switch with MAC addresses using forged ARP packets until the CAM table is full.</p> <p>Once CAM is flooded, the switch goes into hub-like mode and starts broadcasting the traffic that do not have CAM entry. The attacker who is on the same network, now receives all the frames which were destined only for a specific host.</p> <h3>Port Stealing</h3> <p>Ethernet switches have the ability to learn and bind MAC addresses to ports. When a switch receives traffic from a port with a MAC source address, it binds the port number and that MAC address.</p> <p>The port stealing attack exploits this ability of the switches. The attacker floods the switch with forged ARP frames with the target host&rsquo;s MAC address as the source address. Switch is fooled to believe that the target host is on port, on which actually an attacker is connected.</p> <p>Now all data frames intended for the targeted host are sent to the attacker&rsquo;s switch port and not to the target host. Thus, the attacker now receives all the frames which were actually destined only for the target host.</p> <h3>DHCP Attacks</h3> <p>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is not a datalink protocol but solutions to DHCP attacks are also useful to thwart Layer 2 attacks.</p> <p>DHCP is used to dynamically allocate IP addresses to computers for a specific time period. It is possible to attack DHCP servers by causing denial of service in the network or by impersonating the DHCP server. In a DHCP starvation attack, the attacker requests all of the available DHCP addresses. This results in a denial of service to the legitimate host on the network.</p> <p>In DHCP spoofing attack, the attacker can deploy a rogue DHCP server to provide addresses to the clients. Here, the attacker can provide the host machines with a rouge default gateway with the DHCP responses. Data frames from the host are now guided to rouge gateway where the attacker can intercept all package and reply to actual gateway or drop them.</p> <h3>Other Attacks</h3> <p>In addition to above popular attacks, there are other attacks such as Layer 2-based broadcasting, Denial of Service (DoS), MAC cloning.</p> <p>In the broadcasting attack, the attacker sends spoofed ARP replies to the hosts on the network. These ARP replies set the MAC address of the default gateway to the broadcast address. This causes all the outbound traffic to get broadcast, enabling sniffing by the attacker sitting on the same Ethernet. This type of attack also affects the network capacity.</p> <p>In the Layer 2-based DoS attacks, the attacker updates the ARP caches of hosts in the network with non-existent MAC addresses. The MAC address of each network interface card in a network is supposed to be globally unique. However, it can easily be changed by enabling MAC cloning. The attacker disables the target host through DoS attack and then uses the IP and MAC addresses of the targeted host.</p> <p>The attacker executes the attacks to launch the higher level attacks in order to jeopardize the security of information traveling on network. He can intercept all the frames and would be able to read the frame data. The attacker can act as a man-in-middle and modify data or simply drop the frame leading to DoS. He can hijack the ongoing session between the target host and other machines, and communicate wrong information altogether.</p> <h2>Securing Ethernet LANs</h2> <p>We discussed some widely known attacks at Data Link Layer in the previous section. Several methods have been developed to mitigate these types of attacks. Some of the important methods are &minus;</p> <h3>Port Security</h3> <p>It is a layer 2 security feature available on intelligent Ethernet switches. It involves tying a physical port of a switch to a specific MAC address/es. Anyone can access an unsecure network by simply connecting the host to one of the available switch ports. But, port security can secure layer 2 access.</p> <h1><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/port_security.jpg\" alt=\"Port Security\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></h1> <p>By default, port security limits the ingress MAC address count to one. However, it is possible to allow more than one authorized host to connect from that port through configuration. Allowed MAC addresses per interface can be statically configured. A convenient alternative is to enable \"sticky\" MAC address learning where MAC addresses will be dynamically learned by switch port until the maximum limit for the port is reached.</p> <p>To ensure security, reaction to the change in the specified MAC address/es on a port or excess addresses on a port can be controlled in many different ways. The port can be configured to shut down or block the MAC addresses that exceed a specified limit. The recommended best practice is to shut down the port. Port security prevents MAC flooding and cloning attacks.</p> <h3>DHCP Snooping</h3> <p>We have seen that DHCP spoofing is an attack where the attacker listens for DHCP requests from host on the network and answers them with fake DHCP response before the authorized DHCP response comes to the host.</p> <p>DHCP snooping can prevent such attacks. DHCP snooping is a switch feature. Switch can be configured to determine which switch ports can respond to DHCP requests. Switch ports are identified as trusted or untrusted ports.</p> <h1><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/dhcp_snooping.jpg\" alt=\"DHCP Snooping\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></h1> <p>Only ports that connect to an authorized DHCP server are configured as &ldquo;trusted&rdquo;, and allowed to send all types of DHCP messages. All other ports on the switch are untrusted and can send only DHCP requests. If a DHCP response is seen on an untrusted port, the port is shut down.</p> <h3>Preventing ARP Spoofing</h3> <p>The method of port security can prevent MAC flooding and cloning attacks. However, it does not prevent ARP spoofing. Port security validates the MAC source address in the frame header, but ARP frames contain an additional MAC source field in the data payload, and the host uses this field to populate their ARP cache. Some methods to prevent ARP spoofing are listed as follows.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Static ARP</strong>&nbsp;&minus; One of the recommended action is to employ static ARP entries in the host ARP table. Static ARP entries are permanent entries in an ARP cache. However, this method is impractical. Also, it does not allow the use of some Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) as static IP needs to be used for all host in the layer 2 network.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Intrusion Detection System</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The method of defense is to utilize Intrusion Detection System (IDS) configured to detect high amounts of ARP traffic. However, IDS is prone to reporting false positives.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dynamic ARP Inspection</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This method of preventing ARP spoofing is similar to DHCP snooping. It uses trusted and untrusted ports. ARP replies are allowed into the switch interface only on trusted ports. If an ARP reply comes to the switch on an untrusted port, the contents of the ARP reply packet is compared to the DHCP binding table to verify its accuracy. If the ARP reply is not valid, the ARP reply is dropped, and the port is disabled.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Securing Spanning Tree Protocol</h2> <p>Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a layer 2 link management protocol. The main purpose of STP is to ensure that there are no data flow loops when network has redundant paths. Generally, redundant paths are built to provide reliability to the network. But they can form deadly loops which can lead to DoS attack in the network.</p> <h3>Spanning Tree Protocol</h3> <p>In order to provide desired path redundancy, as well as to avoid a loop condition, STP defines a tree that spans all the switches in a network. STP forces certain redundant data links into a blocked state and keeps other links in a forwarding state.</p> <p>If a link in the forwarding state breaks down, STP reconfigures the network and redefines data paths by activating appropriate standby path. STP runs on bridges and switches deployed in the network. All the switches exchange information for root switch selection and for subsequent configuration of the network. Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) carry this information. Through exchange of BPDUs, all the switches in the network elect a root bridge/switch that becomes the focal point in the network and controls the blocked and forwarded links.</p> <h3>Attacks on STP</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Taking Over the Root Bridge. It is one of the most disruptive type of attack at layer 2. By default, a LAN switch takes any BPDU sent from neighboring switch at face value. Incidentally, STP is trustful, stateless, and does not provide any sound authentication mechanism.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once in root attack mode, the attacking switch sends a BPDU every 2 sec with the same priority as the current root bridge, but with a slightly numerically lower MAC address, which ensures its victory in the root-bridge election process. The attacker switch can launch DoS attack either by not properly acknowledging other switches causing BPDU flooding or by subjecting switches to over-process BPDUS by claiming to be root at one time and retracting in quick succession.</p> </li> <li> <p>DoS using Flood of Configuration BPDU. The attacking switch does not attempt to take over as root. Instead, it generates large number of BPDUs per second leading to very high CPU utilization on the switches.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Preventing Attacks on STP</h3> <p>Fortunately, the countermeasure to a root takeover attack is simple and straightforward. Two features help in defeating a root takeover attack.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Root Guard</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Root guard restricts the switch ports out of which the root bridge may be negotiated. If a &lsquo;root-guard-enabled&rsquo; port receives BPDUs that are superior to those that the current root bridge is sending, then that port is moved to a root-inconsistent state, and no data traffic is forwarded across that port. Root guard is best deployed toward ports that connect to switches which are not expected to take over as the root bridge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>BPDU-Guard</strong>&nbsp;&minus; BPDU guard is used to protect the network from the problems that may be caused by the receipt of BPDUs on access ports. These are the ports that should not be receiving them. BPDU guard is best deployed toward user-facing ports to prevent insertion of rogue switch by an attacker.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Securing Virtual LAN</h2> <p>In local networks, Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) are sometimes configured as a security measure to limit the number of hosts susceptible to layer 2 attacks. VLANs create network boundaries, over which broadcast (ARP, DHCP) traffic cannot cross.</p> <h3>Virtual Local Area Network</h3> <p>A network employing switch/es supporting VLAN capabilities can be configured to define multiple VLANs over a single physical LAN infrastructure.</p> <h1><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/virtual_local_area_network.jpg\" alt=\"Virtual Local Area Network\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></h1> <p>The common form of VLAN is a port-based VLAN. In this VLAN structure, the switch ports are grouped into VLAN using switch management software. Thus a single physical switch can act as multiple virtual switches.</p> <p>Employment of VLANs provide traffic isolation. It divides the large broadcast layer 2 network into smaller logical layer 2 networks and thus reduces the scope of attacks such as ARP/DHCP Spoofing. Data frames of one VLAN can move from/to within ports belonging to the same VLAN only. The frames forwarding between two VLANs is done through routing.</p> <p>VLANs generally span multiple switches as shown in the diagram above. The link between trunk ports carry frames of all VLANs defined over multiple physical switches. Hence, VLAN frames forwarded between switches can&rsquo;t be simple IEEE 802.1 Ethernet format frames. Since, these frame move on same physical link, they now need to carry VLAN ID information. IEEE 802.1Q protocol adds/removes additional header fields to plain Ethernet frames forwarded between trunk ports.</p> <h1><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/ethernet_frames.jpg\" alt=\"Ethernet Frames\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></h1> <p>When the field following the two IP addresses fields is 0x8100 (&gt; 1500), the frame is identified as 802.1Q frame. Value of 2-byte Tag Protocol Identifier (TPI) is 81-00. TCI field consist of 3-bit priority information, 1-bit Drop eligible indicator (DEI), and 12-bit VLAN ID. This 3-bit priority field and DEI field are not relevant to VLANs. Priority bits are used for provision of Quality of Service.</p> <p>When a frame does not belong to any VLAN, there is a default VLAN id which the frame is considered to be associated with.</p> <h3>Attack on VLAN &amp; Prevention Measures</h3> <p>In a VLAN hopping attack, an attacker on one VLAN can gain access to the traffic on other VLANs that would normally not be accessible. It would bypass a layer 3 device (router) when communicating from one VLAN to another, thus defeating the purpose of VLAN creation.</p> <p>VLAN hopping can be performed by two methods; switch spoofing and double tagging.</p> <h3>Switch Spoofing</h3> <p>It can occur when the switch port, to which the attacker is connected, is either in &lsquo;trunking&rsquo; mode or &lsquo;auto-negotiation&rsquo; mode. The attacker acts as a switch and adds 802.1Q encapsulation headers with VLAN tags for target remote VLANs to its outgoing frames. The receiving switch interprets those frames as sourced from another 802.1Q switch, and forwards the frames into the target VLAN.</p> <p>The two preventive measures against switch spoofing attacks are to set edge ports to static access mode and to disable auto-negotiation on all ports.</p> <h3>Double Tagging</h3> <p>In this attack, an attacker connected on native VLAN port of switch prepends two VLAN tags in the frame header. The first tag is of native VLAN and second is for target VLAN. When the first switch receives the attacker&rsquo;s frames, it removes the first tag since frames of native VLAN are forwarded without tag on trunk port.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Since the second tag was never removed by the first switch, the receiving switch identifies the remaining tag as the VLAN destination and forwards the frames to the target host in that VLAN. The double tagging attack exploits the concept of native VLAN. Since VLAN 1 is the default VLAN for access ports and the default native VLAN on trunks, it&rsquo;s an easy target.</p> </li> <li> <p>The first prevention measure is to remove all access ports from the default VLAN 1 since the attacker&rsquo;s port must match that of the switch&rsquo;s native VLAN. The second prevention measure is to assign the native VLAN on all switch trunks to some unused VLAN, say VLAN id 999. And lastly, all switches be configured to carry out explicit tagging of native VLAN frames on the trunk port.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Securing Wireless LAN</h2> <p>Wireless local area network is a network of wireless nodes within a limited geographic area, such as an office building or school campus. Nodes are capable of radio communication.</p> <h3>Wireless LAN</h3> <p>Wireless LAN is usually implemented as extensions of existing wired LAN to provide network access with device mobility. The most widely implemented wireless LAN technologies are based on the IEEE 802.11 standard and its amendments.</p> <p>The two main components in wireless LAN are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Access Points (APs)</strong>&nbsp;&minus; These are base stations for the wireless network. They transmit and receive radio frequencies to communicate with wireless clients.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Wireless Clients</strong>&nbsp;&minus; These are computing devices that are equipped with a Wireless Network Interface Card (WNIC). Laptops, IP Phones, PDAs are typical examples of wireless clients.</p> </li> </ul> <h1><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/wireless_lan.jpg\" alt=\"Wireless LAN\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></h1> <p>Many organizations have implemented wireless LANs. These networks are growing phenomenally. It is thus, crucial to understand threats in wireless LANs and learn the common preventive measure to ensure network security.</p> <h3>Attacks in Wireless LAN</h3> <p>The typical attacks that are carried out on Wireless LAN are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Eavesdropping</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The attacker passively monitors wireless networks for data, including authentication credentials.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Masquerading</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The attacker impersonates an authorized user and gains access and privileges on wireless networks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Traffic Analysis</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The attacker monitors transmissions via wireless networks to identify communication patterns and participants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Denial of Service</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The attacker prevents or restricts the normal use or management of wireless LAN or network devices.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Message Modification/Replay</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The attacker alters or replies to a legitimate message sent via wireless networks by deleting, adding to, changing, or reordering it.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Security Measures in Wireless LAN</h3> <p>Security measures provide means to defeat attacks and manage risks to the networks. These are network management, operation, and technical measures. We describe below the technical measures adopted to ensure confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data transmitted via wireless LANs.</p> <p>In wireless LANs, all APs should be configured to provide security through encryption and client authentication. The types of schemes used in Wireless LAN to provide security are as follows &minus;</p> <h3>Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)</h3> <p>It is an encryption algorithm built into the 802.11 standard to secure wireless networks. WEP encryption uses the RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4) stream cipher with 40-bit/104-bit keys and a 24-bit initialization vector. It can also provide endpoint authentication.</p> <p>It is, however, the weakest encryption security mechanism, as a number of flaws have been discovered in WEP encryption. WEP also does not have authentication protocol. Hence, using WEP is not highly recommended.</p> <h3>802.11i Protocol</h3> <p>In this protocol numerous and stronger forms of encryption are possible. It has been developed to replace weak WEP scheme. It provides key distribution mechanism. It supports one key per station, and does not use the same key for all. It uses authentication server separate from the access point.</p> <p>IEEE802.11i mandates the use of a protocol named Counter mode with CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP). CCMP provides confidentiality and integrity of the data transferred and authenticity of the sender. It is based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) block cipher.</p> <p>The IEEE802.11i protocol has four phases of operation.</p> <h1><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/802.11i_protocol.jpg\" alt=\"802.11i Protocol\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></h1> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>STA and AP communicate and discover mutual security capabilities such as supported algorithms.</p> </li> <li> <p>STA and AS mutually authenticate and together generate Master Key (MK). AP acts as &ldquo;pass through&rdquo;.</p> </li> <li> <p>STA derives Pairwise Master Key (PMK). AS derives same PMK and sends to AP.</p> </li> <li> <p>STA, AP use PMK to derive Temporal Key (TK) to be used for message encryption and data integrity.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Other Standards</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Wi-Fi Protected Access</strong>&nbsp;(WPA) &minus; This protocol implements the majority of the IEEE 802.11i standard. It existed before IEEE 802.11i and uses RC4 algorithm for encryption. It has two modes of operation. In &lsquo;Enterprise&rsquo; mode, WPA uses authentication protocol 802.1x to communicate with authentication server, and hence pre-master keys (PMK) is specific to client station. In &lsquo;Personal&rsquo; mode, it does not use 802.1x, PMK is replaced by a pre-shared key, as used for Small Office Home Office (SOHO) wireless LAN environments.</p> <p>WPA also includes a sound message integrity check replacing the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) that was used by the WEP standard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>WPA2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; WPA2 replaced the WPA. WPA2 implements all mandatory elements of IEEE 802.11i scheme. In particular, it includes mandatory support for CCMP, an AES-based encryption mode with strong security. Thus, as far as the attacks are concerned, WPA2 / IEEE802.11i provides adequate solutions to defend against WEP weaknesses, man-in-the-middle attacks, forgery packets forgery, and replay attacks. However, DoS attack is not addressed properly and there are no solid protocols to stop such attacks basically because such attacks target the physical layer like interfering with the frequency band.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>In this chapter, we considered attacks and mitigation techniques assuming a switched Ethernet network running IP. If your network does not use Ethernet as layer 2 protocol, some of these attacks may not be applicable, but chances are such network is vulnerable to different types of attacks.</p> <p>Security is only as strong as the weakest link. When it comes to networking, layer 2 can be a very weak link. Layer 2 security measures mentioned in this chapter go a long way towards protecting a network from many types of attacks.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

            "<h1>Network Security &ndash; Access Control</h1> <p>Network access control is a method of enhancing the security of a private organizational network by restricting the availability of network resources to endpoint devices that comply with the organization&rsquo;s security policy. A typical network access control scheme comprises of two major components such as Restricted Access and Network Boundary Protection.</p> <p>Restricted Access to the network devices is achieved through user authentication and authorization control which is responsible for identifying and authenticating different users to the network system. Authorization is the process of granting or denying specific access permissions to a protected resource.</p> <p><strong>Network Boundary Protection</strong>&nbsp;controls logical connectivity into and out of networks. For example, multiple firewalls can be deployed to prevent unauthorized access to the network systems. Also intrusion detection and prevention technologies can be deployed to defend against attacks from the Internet.</p> <p>In this chapter, we will discuss the methods for user identification and authentication for network access followed by various types of firewalls and intrusion detection systems.</p> <h2>Securing Access to Network Devices</h2> <p>Restricting access to the devices on network is a very essential step for securing a network. Since network devices comprise of communication as well as computing equipment, compromising these can potentially bring down an entire network and its resources.</p> <p>Paradoxically, many organizations ensure excellent security for their servers and applications but leave communicating network devices with rudimentary security.</p> <p>An important aspect of network device security is access control and authorization. Many protocols have been developed to address these two requirements and enhance network security to higher levels.</p> <h2>User Authentication and Authorization</h2> <p>User authentication is necessary to control access to the network systems, in particular network infrastructure devices. Authentication has two aspects: general access authentication and functional authorization.</p> <p>General access authentication is the method to control whether a particular user has &ldquo;any&rdquo; type of access right to the system he is trying to connect to. Usually, this kind of access is associated with the user having an &ldquo;account&rdquo; with that system. Authorization deals with individual user &ldquo;rights&rdquo;. For example, it decides what can a user do once authenticated; the user may be authorized to configure the device or only view the data.</p> <p>User authentication depends up on factors that include something he knows (password), something he has (cryptographic token), or something he is (biometric). The use of more than one factor for identification and authentication provides the basis for Multifactor authentication.</p> <h2>Password Based Authentication</h2> <p>At a minimum level, all network devices should have username-password authentication. The password should be non-trivial (at least 10 character, mixed alphabets, numbers, and symbols).</p> <p>In case of remote access by the user, a method should be used to ensure usernames and passwords are not passed in the clear over the network. Also, passwords should also be changed with some reasonable frequency.</p> <h2>Centralized Authentication Methods</h2> <p>Individual device based authentication system provides a basic access control measure. However, a centralized authentication method is considered more effective and efficient when the network has large number of devices with large numbers of users accessing these devices.</p> <p>Traditionally, centralized authentication was used to solve problems faced in remote network access. In Remote Access Systems (RAS), the administration of users on the network devices is not practical. Placing all user information in all devices and then keeping that information up-to-date is an administrative nightmare.</p> <p>Centralized authentication systems, such as RADIUS and Kerberos, solve this problem. These centralized methods allow user information to be stored and managed in one place. These systems can usually be seamlessly integrated with other user account management schemes such as Microsoft&rsquo;s Active Directory or LDAP directories. Most RADIUS servers can communicate with other network devices in the normal RADIUS protocol and then securely access account information stored in the directories.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/centralized_authentication_methods.jpg\" alt=\"Centralized Authentication Methods\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>For example, Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Authentication Server (IAS) bridges RADIUS and Active Directory to provide centralized authentication for the users of devices. It also ensures that the user account information is unified with the Microsoft domain accounts. The above diagram shows a Windows Domain controller operating as both an Active Directory server and a RADIUS server for network elements to authenticate into an Active Directory domain.</p> <h2>Access Control Lists</h2> <p>Many network devices can be configured with access lists. These lists define hostnames or IP addresses that are authorized for accessing the device. It is typical, for instance, to restrict access to network equipment from IPs except for the network administrator.</p> <p>This would then protect against any type of access that might be unauthorized. These types of access lists serve as an important last defense and can be quite powerful on some devices with different rules for different access protocols.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

          "details": [
            "<h1>Network Security &ndash; Firewalls</h1> <p>Almost every medium and large-scale organization has a presence on the Internet and has an organizational network connected to it. Network partitioning at the boundary between the outside Internet and the internal network is essential for network security. Sometimes the inside network (intranet) is referred to as the &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; side and the external Internet as the &ldquo;un-trusted&rdquo; side.</p> <h2>Types of Firewall</h2> <p>Firewall is a network device that isolates organization&rsquo;s internal network from larger outside network/Internet. It can be a hardware, software, or combined system that prevents unauthorized access to or from internal network.</p> <p>All data packets entering or leaving the internal network pass through the firewall, which examines each packet and blocks those that do not meet the specified security criteria.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/firewall.jpg\" alt=\"Firewall\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>Deploying firewall at network boundary is like aggregating the security at a single point. It is analogous to locking an apartment at the entrance and not necessarily at each door.</p> <p>Firewall is considered as an essential element to achieve network security for the following reasons &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Internal network and hosts are unlikely to be properly secured.</p> </li> <li> <p>Internet is a dangerous place with criminals, users from competing companies, disgruntled ex-employees, spies from unfriendly countries, vandals, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>To prevent an attacker from launching denial of service attacks on network resource.</p> </li> <li> <p>To prevent illegal modification/access to internal data by an outsider attacker.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Firewall is categorized into three basic types &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Packet filter (Stateless &amp; Stateful)</li> <li>Application-level gateway</li> <li>Circuit-level gateway</li> </ul> <p>These three categories, however, are not mutually exclusive. Modern firewalls have a mix of abilities that may place them in more than one of the three categories.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/firewalls_types.jpg\" alt=\"Firewalls Types\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\" /></p> <h2>Stateless &amp; Stateful Packet Filtering Firewall</h2> <p>In this type of firewall deployment, the internal network is connected to the external network/Internet via a router firewall. The firewall inspects and filters data packet-by-packet.</p> <p><strong>Packet-filtering firewalls</strong>&nbsp;allow or block the packets mostly based on criteria such as source and/or destination IP addresses, protocol, source and/or destination port numbers, and various other parameters within the IP header.</p> <p>The decision can be based on factors other than IP header fields such as ICMP message type, TCP SYN and ACK bits, etc.</p> <p>Packet filter rule has two parts &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Selection criteria</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is a used as a condition and pattern matching for decision making.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Action field</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This part specifies action to be taken if an IP packet meets the selection criteria. The action could be either block (deny) or permit (allow) the packet across the firewall.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Packet filtering is generally accomplished by configuring Access Control Lists (ACL) on routers or switches. ACL is a table of packet filter rules.</p> <p>As traffic enters or exits an interface, firewall applies ACLs from top to bottom to each incoming packet, finds matching criteria and either permits or denies the individual packets.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/stateless_packet_firewall.jpg\" alt=\"Stateless Packet Firewall\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p><strong>Stateless firewall</strong>&nbsp;is a kind of a rigid tool. It looks at packet and allows it if its meets the criteria even if it is not part of any established ongoing communication.</p> <p>Hence, such firewalls are replaced by&nbsp;<strong>stateful firewalls</strong>&nbsp;in modern networks. This type of firewalls offer a more in-depth inspection method over the only ACL based packet inspection methods of stateless firewalls.</p> <p>Stateful firewall monitors the connection setup and teardown process to keep a check on connections at the TCP/IP level. This allows them to keep track of connections state and determine which hosts have open, authorized connections at any given point in time.</p> <p>They reference the rule base only when a new connection is requested. Packets belonging to existing connections are compared to the firewall's state table of open connections, and decision to allow or block is taken. This process saves time and provides added security as well. No packet is allowed to trespass the firewall unless it belongs to already established connection. It can timeout inactive connections at firewall after which it no longer admit packets for that connection.</p> <h2>Application Gateways</h2> <p>An application-level gateway acts as a relay node for the application-level traffic. They intercept incoming and outgoing packets, run proxies that copy and forward information across the gateway, and function as a&nbsp;<strong><em>proxy server</em></strong>, preventing any direct connection between a trusted server or client and an untrusted host.</p> <p>The proxies are application specific. They can filter packets at the application layer of the OSI model.</p> <h3>Application-specific Proxies</h3> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/application_specific_proxies.jpg\" alt=\"Application-specific Proxies\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>An application-specific proxy accepts packets generated by only specified application for which they are designed to copy, forward, and filter. For example, only a Telnet proxy can copy, forward, and filter Telnet traffic.</p> <p>If a network relies only on an application-level gateway, incoming and outgoing packets cannot access services that have no proxies configured. For example, if a gateway runs FTP and Telnet proxies, only packets generated by these services can pass through the firewall. All other services are blocked.</p> <h3>Application-level Filtering</h3> <p>An application-level proxy gateway, examines and filters individual packets, rather than simply copying them and blindly forwarding them across the gateway. Application-specific proxies check each packet that passes through the gateway, verifying the contents of the packet up through the application layer. These proxies can filter particular kinds of commands or information in the application protocols.</p> <p>Application gateways can restrict specific actions from being performed. For example, the gateway could be configured to prevent users from performing the &lsquo;FTP put&rsquo; command. This can prevent modification of the information stored on the server by an attacker.</p> <h3>Transparent</h3> <p>Although application-level gateways can be transparent, many implementations require user authentication before users can access an untrusted network, a process that reduces true transparency. Authentication may be different if the user is from the internal network or from the Internet. For an internal network, a simple list of IP addresses can be allowed to connect to external applications. But from the Internet side a strong authentication should be implemented.</p> <p>An application gateway actually relays TCP segments between the two TCP connections in the two directions (Client &harr; Proxy &harr; Server).</p> <p>For outbound packets, the gateway may replace the source IP address by its own IP address. The process is referred to as Network Address Translation (NAT). It ensures that internal IP addresses are not exposed to the Internet.</p> <h2>Circuit-Level Gateway</h2> <p>The circuit-level gateway is an intermediate solution between the packet filter and the application gateway. It runs at the transport layer and hence can act as proxy for any application.</p> <p>Similar to an application gateway, the circuit-level gateway also does not permit an end-to-end TCP connection across the gateway. It sets up two TCP connections and relays the TCP segments from one network to the other. But, it does not examine the application data like application gateway. Hence, sometime it is called as &lsquo;Pipe Proxy&rsquo;.</p> <h3>SOCKS</h3> <p>SOCKS (RFC 1928) refers to a circuit-level gateway. It is a networking proxy mechanism that enables hosts on one side of a SOCKS server to gain full access to hosts on the other side without requiring direct IP reachability. The client connects to the SOCKS server at the firewall. Then the client enters a negotiation for the authentication method to be used, and authenticates with the chosen method.</p> <p>The client sends a connection relay request to the SOCKS server, containing the desired destination IP address and transport port. The server accepts the request after checking that the client meets the basic filtering criteria. Then, on behalf of the client, the gateway opens a connection to the requested untrusted host and then closely monitors the TCP handshaking that follows.</p> <p>The SOCKS server informs the client, and in case of success, starts relaying the data between the two connections. Circuit level gateways are used when the organization trusts the internal users, and does not want to inspect the contents or application data sent on the Internet.</p> <h2>Firewall Deployment with DMZ</h2> <p>A firewall is a mechanism used to control network traffic &lsquo;into&rsquo; and &lsquo;out&rsquo; of an organizational internal network. In most cases these systems have two network interfaces, one for the external network such as the Internet and the other for the internal side.</p> <p>The firewall process can tightly control what is allowed to traverse from one side to the other. An organization that wishes to provide external access to its web server can restrict all traffic arriving at firewall expect for port 80 (the standard http port). All other traffic such as mail traffic, FTP, SNMP, etc., is not allowed across the firewall into the internal network. An example of a simple firewall is shown in the following diagram.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/firewall_deployment_with_dmz.jpg\" alt=\"Firewall Deployment with DMZ\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <p>In the above simple deployment, though all other accesses from outside are blocked, it is possible for an attacker to contact not only a web server but any other host on internal network that has left port 80 open by accident or otherwise.</p> <p>Hence, the problem most organizations face is how to enable legitimate access to public services such as web, FTP, and e-mail while maintaining tight security of the internal network. The typical approach is deploying firewalls to provide a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in the network.</p> <p>In this setup (illustrated in following diagram), two firewalls are deployed; one between the external network and the DMZ, and another between the DMZ and the internal network. All public servers are placed in the DMZ.</p> <p>With this setup, it is possible to have firewall rules which allow public access to the public servers but the interior firewall can restrict all incoming connections. By having the DMZ, the public servers are provided with adequate protection instead of placing them directly on external network.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/dual_firewall_deployment.jpg\" alt=\"Dual Firewall Deployment\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <h2>Intrusion Detection / Prevention System</h2> <p>The packet filtering firewalls operate based on rules involving TCP/UDP/IP headers only. They do not attempt to establish correlation checks among different sessions.</p> <p>Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) carry out Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) by looking at the packet contents. For example, checking character strings in packet against database of known virus, attack strings.</p> <p>Application gateways do look at the packet contents but only for specific applications. They do not look for suspicious data in the packet. IDS/IPS looks for suspicious data contained in packets and tries to examine correlation among multiple packets to identify any attacks such as port scanning, network mapping, and denial of service and so on.</p> <h3>Difference between IDS and IPS</h3> <p>IDS and IPS are similar in detection of anomalies in the network. IDS is a &lsquo;visibility&rsquo; tool whereas IPS is considered as a &lsquo;control&rsquo; tool.</p> <p>Intrusion Detection Systems sit off to the side of the network, monitoring traffic at many different points, and provide visibility into the security state of the network. In case of reporting of anomaly by IDS, the corrective actions are initiated by the network administrator or other device on the network.</p> <p>Intrusion Prevention System are like firewall and they sit in-line between two networks and control the traffic going through them. It enforces a specified policy on detection of anomaly in the network traffic. Generally, it drops all packets and blocks the entire network traffic on noticing an anomaly till such time an anomaly is addressed by the administrator.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/network_security/images/ids_vs_ips.jpg\" alt=\"IDS Vs IPS\" style=\"max-width:100%;height:auto;\"/></p> <h2>Types of IDS</h2> <p>There are two basic types of IDS.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Signature-based IDS</strong></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>It needs a database of known attacks with their signatures.</p> </li> <li> <p>Signature is defined by types and order of packets characterizing a particular attack.</p> </li> <li> <p>Limitation of this type of IDS is that only known attacks can be detected. This IDS can also throw up a false alarm. False alarm can occur when a normal packet stream matches the signature of an attack.</p> </li> <li> <p>Well-known public open-source IDS example is &ldquo;Snort&rdquo; IDS.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Anomaly-based IDS</strong></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>This type of IDS creates a traffic pattern of normal network operation.</p> </li> <li> <p>During IDS mode, it looks at traffic patterns that are statistically unusual. For example, ICMP unusual load, exponential growth in port scans, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Detection of any unusual traffic pattern generates the alarm.</p> </li> <li> <p>The major challenge faced in this type of IDS deployment is the difficulty in distinguishing between normal traffic and unusual traffic.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>In this chapter, we discussed the various mechanisms employed for network access control. The approach to network security through access control is technically different than implementing security controls at different network layers discussed in the earlier chapters of this tutorial. However, though the approaches of implementation are different, they are complementary to each other.</p> <p>Network access control comprises of two main components: user authentication and network boundary protection. RADIUS is a popular mechanism for providing central authentication in the network.</p> <p>Firewall provides network boundary protection by separating an internal network from the public Internet. Firewall can function at different layers of network protocol. IDS/IPS allows to monitor the anomalies in the network traffic to detect the attack and take preventive action against the same.</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#0000FF; } </style>"

            "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Types of Operating System</h1> <p>Operating systems are there from the very first computer generation and they keep evolving with time. In this chapter, we will discuss some of the important types of operating systems which are most commonly used.</p> <h2>Batch operating system</h2> <p>The users of a batch operating system do not interact with the computer directly. Each user prepares his job on an off-line device like punch cards and submits it to the computer operator. To speed up processing, jobs with similar needs are batched together and run as a group. The programmers leave their programs with the operator and the operator then sorts the programs with similar requirements into batches.</p> <p>The problems with Batch Systems are as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Lack of interaction between the user and the job.</li> <li>CPU is often idle, because the speed of the mechanical I/O devices is slower than the CPU.</li> <li>Difficult to provide the desired priority.</li> </ul> <h2>Time-sharing operating systems</h2> <p>Time-sharing is a technique which enables many people, located at various terminals, to use a particular computer system at the same time. Time-sharing or multitasking is a logical extension of multiprogramming. Processor's time which is shared among multiple users simultaneously is termed as time-sharing.</p> <p>The main difference between Multiprogrammed Batch Systems and Time-Sharing Systems is that in case of Multiprogrammed batch systems, the objective is to maximize processor use, whereas in Time-Sharing Systems, the objective is to minimize response time.</p> <p>Multiple jobs are executed by the CPU by switching between them, but the switches occur so frequently. Thus, the user can receive an immediate response. For example, in a transaction processing, the processor executes each user program in a short burst or quantum of computation. That is, if&nbsp;<strong>n</strong>users are present, then each user can get a time quantum. When the user submits the command, the response time is in few seconds at most.</p> <p>The operating system uses CPU scheduling and multiprogramming to provide each user with a small portion of a time. Computer systems that were designed primarily as batch systems have been modified to time-sharing systems.</p> <p>Advantages of Timesharing operating systems are as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Provides the advantage of quick response.</li> <li>Avoids duplication of software.</li> <li>Reduces CPU idle time.</li> </ul> <p>Disadvantages of Time-sharing operating systems are as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Problem of reliability.</li> <li>Question of security and integrity of user programs and data.</li> <li>Problem of data communication.</li> </ul> <h2>Distributed operating System</h2> <p>Distributed systems use multiple central processors to serve multiple real-time applications and multiple users. Data processing jobs are distributed among the processors accordingly.</p> <p>The processors communicate with one another through various communication lines (such as high-speed buses or telephone lines). These are referred as&nbsp;<strong>loosely coupled systems</strong>&nbsp;or distributed systems. Processors in a distributed system may vary in size and function. These processors are referred as sites, nodes, computers, and so on.</p> <p>The advantages of distributed systems are as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>With resource sharing facility, a user at one site may be able to use the resources available at another.</li> <li>Speedup the exchange of data with one another via electronic mail.</li> <li>If one site fails in a distributed system, the remaining sites can potentially continue operating.</li> <li>Better service to the customers.</li> <li>Reduction of the load on the host computer.</li> <li>Reduction of delays in data processing.</li> </ul> <h2>Network operating System</h2> <p>A Network Operating System runs on a server and provides the server the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking functions. The primary purpose of the network operating system is to allow shared file and printer access among multiple computers in a network, typically a local area network (LAN), a private network or to other networks.</p> <p>Examples of network operating systems include Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Microsoft Windows Server 2008, UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X, Novell NetWare, and BSD.</p> <p>The advantages of network operating systems are as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Centralized servers are highly stable.</li> <li>Security is server managed.</li> <li>Upgrades to new technologies and hardware can be easily integrated into the system.</li> <li>Remote access to servers is possible from different locations and types of systems.</li> </ul> <p>The disadvantages of network operating systems are as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>High cost of buying and running a server.</li> <li>Dependency on a central location for most operations.</li> <li>Regular maintenance and updates are required.</li> </ul> <h2>Real Time operating System</h2> <p>A real-time system is defined as a data processing system in which the time interval required to process and respond to inputs is so small that it controls the environment. The time taken by the system to respond to an input and display of required updated information is termed as the&nbsp;<strong>response time</strong>. So in this method, the response time is very less as compared to online processing.</p> <p>Real-time systems are used when there are rigid time requirements on the operation of a processor or the flow of data and real-time systems can be used as a control device in a dedicated application. A real-time operating system must have well-defined, fixed time constraints, otherwise the system will fail. For example, Scientific experiments, medical imaging systems, industrial control systems, weapon systems, robots, air traffic control systems, etc.</p> <p>There are two types of real-time operating systems.</p> <h3>Hard real-time systems</h3> <p>Hard real-time systems guarantee that critical tasks complete on time. In hard real-time systems, secondary storage is limited or missing and the data is stored in ROM. In these systems, virtual memory is almost never found.</p> <h3>Soft real-time systems</h3> <p>Soft real-time systems are less restrictive. A critical real-time task gets priority over other tasks and retains the priority until it completes. Soft real-time systems have limited utility than hard real-time systems. For example, multimedia, virtual reality, Advanced Scientific Projects like undersea exploration and planetary rovers, etc.</p>"

            "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Operating System - Process Scheduling</h1> <h2>Definition</h2> <p>The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.</p> <p>Process scheduling is an essential part of Multiprogramming operating systems. Such operating systems allow more than one process to be loaded into the executable memory at a time and the loaded process shares the CPU using time multiplexing.</p> <h2>Process Scheduling Queues</h2> <p>The OS maintains all PCBs in Process Scheduling Queues. The OS maintains a separate queue for each of the process states and PCBs of all processes in the same execution state are placed in the same queue. When the state of a process is changed, its PCB is unlinked from its current queue and moved to its new state queue.</p> <p>The Operating System maintains the following important process scheduling queues &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Job queue</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This queue keeps all the processes in the system.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ready queue</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This queue keeps a set of all processes residing in main memory, ready and waiting to execute. A new process is always put in this queue.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Device queues</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The processes which are blocked due to unavailability of an I/O device constitute this queue.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/queuing_diagram.jpg\" alt=\"Process Scheduling Queuing\" /></p> <p>The OS can use different policies to manage each queue (FIFO, Round Robin, Priority, etc.). The OS scheduler determines how to move processes between the ready and run queues which can only have one entry per processor core on the system; in the above diagram, it has been merged with the CPU.</p> <h2>Two-State Process Model</h2> <p>Two-state process model refers to running and non-running states which are described below &minus;</p> <table class=\"table table-bordered\" border=\"1\"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.N.</th> <th>State &amp; Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td> <p><strong>Running</strong></p> <p>When a new process is created, it enters into the system as in the running state.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td> <p><strong>Not Running</strong></p> <p>Processes that are not running are kept in queue, waiting for their turn to execute. Each entry in the queue is a pointer to a particular process. Queue is implemented by using linked list. Use of dispatcher is as follows. When a process is interrupted, that process is transferred in the waiting queue. If the process has completed or aborted, the process is discarded. In either case, the dispatcher then selects a process from the queue to execute.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2>Schedulers</h2> <p>Schedulers are special system software which handle process scheduling in various ways. Their main task is to select the jobs to be submitted into the system and to decide which process to run. Schedulers are of three types &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Long-Term Scheduler</li> <li>Short-Term Scheduler</li> <li>Medium-Term Scheduler</li> </ul> <h2>Long Term Scheduler</h2> <p>It is also called a&nbsp;<strong>job scheduler</strong>. A long-term scheduler determines which programs are admitted to the system for processing. It selects processes from the queue and loads them into memory for execution. Process loads into the memory for CPU scheduling.</p> <p>The primary objective of the job scheduler is to provide a balanced mix of jobs, such as I/O bound and processor bound. It also controls the degree of multiprogramming. If the degree of multiprogramming is stable, then the average rate of process creation must be equal to the average departure rate of processes leaving the system.</p> <p>On some systems, the long-term scheduler may not be available or minimal. Time-sharing operating systems have no long term scheduler. When a process changes the state from new to ready, then there is use of long-term scheduler.</p> <h2>Short Term Scheduler</h2> <p>It is also called as&nbsp;<strong>CPU scheduler</strong>. Its main objective is to increase system performance in accordance with the chosen set of criteria. It is the change of ready state to running state of the process. CPU scheduler selects a process among the processes that are ready to execute and allocates CPU to one of them.</p> <p>Short-term schedulers, also known as dispatchers, make the decision of which process to execute next. Short-term schedulers are faster than long-term schedulers.</p> <h2>Medium Term Scheduler</h2> <p>Medium-term scheduling is a part of&nbsp;<strong>swapping</strong>. It removes the processes from the memory. It reduces the degree of multiprogramming. The medium-term scheduler is in-charge of handling the swapped out-processes.</p> <p>A running process may become suspended if it makes an I/O request. A suspended processes cannot make any progress towards completion. In this condition, to remove the process from memory and make space for other processes, the suspended process is moved to the secondary storage. This process is called&nbsp;<strong>swapping</strong>, and the process is said to be swapped out or rolled out. Swapping may be necessary to improve the process mix.</p> <h2>Comparison among Scheduler</h2> <table class=\"table table-bordered\" border=\"1\"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.N.</th> <th>Long-Term Scheduler</th> <th>Short-Term Scheduler</th> <th>Medium-Term Scheduler</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>It is a job scheduler</td> <td>It is a CPU scheduler</td> <td>It is a process swapping scheduler.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Speed is lesser than short term scheduler</td> <td>Speed is fastest among other two</td> <td>Speed is in between both short and long term scheduler.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>It controls the degree of multiprogramming</td> <td>It provides lesser control over degree of multiprogramming</td> <td>It reduces the degree of multiprogramming.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>It is almost absent or minimal in time sharing system</td> <td>It is also minimal in time sharing system</td> <td>It is a part of Time sharing systems.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>It selects processes from pool and loads them into memory for execution</td> <td>It selects those processes which are ready to execute</td> <td>It can re-introduce the process into memory and execution can be continued.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2>Context Switch</h2> <p>A context switch is the mechanism to store and restore the state or context of a CPU in Process Control block so that a process execution can be resumed from the same point at a later time. Using this technique, a context switcher enables multiple processes to share a single CPU. Context switching is an essential part of a multitasking operating system features.</p> <p>When the scheduler switches the CPU from executing one process to execute another, the state from the current running process is stored into the process control block. After this, the state for the process to run next is loaded from its own PCB and used to set the PC, registers, etc. At that point, the second process can start executing.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/context_switch.jpg\" alt=\"Process Context Switch\" /></p> <p>Context switches are computationally intensive since register and memory state must be saved and restored. To avoid the amount of context switching time, some hardware systems employ two or more sets of processor registers. When the process is switched, the following information is stored for later use.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Program Counter</li> <li>Scheduling information</li> <li>Base and limit register value</li> <li>Currently used register</li> <li>Changed State</li> <li>I/O State information</li> <li>Accounting information</li> </ul>"

The thread library contains code for creating and destroying threads, for passing message and data between threads, for scheduling thread execution and for saving and restoring thread contexts. The application starts with a single thread.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/user_threads.jpg\" alt=\"User level thread\" /></p> <h3>Advantages</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Thread switching does not require Kernel mode privileges.</li> <li>User level thread can run on any operating system.</li> <li>Scheduling can be application specific in the user level thread.</li> <li>User level threads are fast to create and manage.</li> </ul> <h3>Disadvantages</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>In a typical operating system, most system calls are blocking.</li> <li>Multithreaded application cannot take advantage of multiprocessing.</li> </ul> <h2>Kernel Level Threads</h2> <p>In this case, thread management is done by the Kernel. There is no thread management code in the application area. Kernel threads are supported directly by the operating system. Any application can be programmed to be multithreaded. All of the threads within an application are supported within a single process.</p> <p>The Kernel maintains context information for the process as a whole and for individuals threads within the process. Scheduling by the Kernel is done on a thread basis. The Kernel performs thread creation, scheduling and management in Kernel space. Kernel threads are generally slower to create and manage than the user threads.</p> <h3>Advantages</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Kernel can simultaneously schedule multiple threads from the same process on multiple processes.</li> <li>If one thread in a process is blocked, the Kernel can schedule another thread of the same process.</li> <li>Kernel routines themselves can be multithreaded.</li> </ul> <h3>Disadvantages</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Kernel threads are generally slower to create and manage than the user threads.</li> <li>Transfer of control from one thread to another within the same process requires a mode switch to the Kernel.</li> </ul> <h2>Multithreading Models</h2> <p>Some operating system provide a combined user level thread and Kernel level thread facility. Solaris is a good example of this combined approach. In a combined system, multiple threads within the same application can run in parallel on multiple processors and a blocking system call need not block the entire process. Multithreading models are three types</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Many to many relationship.</li> <li>Many to one relationship.</li> <li>One to one relationship.</li> </ul> <h2>Many to Many Model</h2> <p>The many-to-many model multiplexes any number of user threads onto an equal or smaller number of kernel threads.</p> <p>The following diagram shows the many-to-many threading model where 6 user level threads are multiplexing with 6 kernel level threads. In this model, developers can create as many user threads as necessary and the corresponding Kernel threads can run in parallel on a multiprocessor machine. This model provides the best accuracy on concurrency and when a thread performs a blocking system call, the kernel can schedule another thread for execution.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/many_to_many.jpg\" alt=\"Many to many thread model\" /></p> <h2>Many to One Model</h2> <p>Many-to-one model maps many user level threads to one Kernel-level thread. Thread management is done in user space by the thread library. When thread makes a blocking system call, the entire process will be blocked. Only one thread can access the Kernel at a time, so multiple threads are unable to run in parallel on multiprocessors.</p> <p>If the user-level thread libraries are implemented in the operating system in such a way that the system does not support them, then the Kernel threads use the many-to-one relationship modes.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/many_to_one.jpg\" alt=\"Many to one thread model\" /></p> <h2>One to One Model</h2> <p>There is one-to-one relationship of user-level thread to the kernel-level thread. This model provides more concurrency than the many-to-one model. It also allows another thread to run when a thread makes a blocking system call. It supports multiple threads to execute in parallel on microprocessors.</p> <p>Disadvantage of this model is that creating user thread requires the corresponding Kernel thread. OS/2, windows NT and windows 2000 use one to one relationship model.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/one_to_one.jpg\" alt=\"One to one thread model\" /></p> <h2>Difference between User-Level &amp; Kernel-Level Thread</h2> <table class=\"table table-bordered\" border=\"1\"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.N.</th> <th>User-Level Threads</th> <th>Kernel-Level Thread</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>User-level threads are faster to create and manage.</td> <td>Kernel-level threads are slower to create and manage.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Implementation is by a thread library at the user level.</td> <td>Operating system supports creation of Kernel threads.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>User-level thread is generic and can run on any operating system.</td> <td>Kernel-level thread is specific to the operating system.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Multi-threaded applications cannot take advantage of multiprocessing.</td> <td>Kernel routines themselves can be multithreaded.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>"

            "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Operating System - Memory Management</h1> <p>Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. Memory management keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of either it is allocated to some process or it is free. It checks how much memory is to be allocated to processes. It decides which process will get memory at what time. It tracks whenever some memory gets freed or unallocated and correspondingly it updates the status.</p> <p>This tutorial will teach you basic concepts related to Memory Management.</p> <h2>Process Address Space</h2> <p>The process address space is the set of logical addresses that a process references in its code. For example, when 32-bit addressing is in use, addresses can range from 0 to 0x7fffffff; that is, 2^31 possible numbers, for a total theoretical size of 2 gigabytes.</p> <p>The operating system takes care of mapping the logical addresses to physical addresses at the time of memory allocation to the program. There are three types of addresses used in a program before and after memory is allocated &minus;</p> <table class=\"table table-bordered\" border=\"1\"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.N.</th> <th>Memory Addresses &amp; Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td> <p><strong>Symbolic addresses</strong></p> <p>The addresses used in a source code. The variable names, constants, and instruction labels are the basic elements of the symbolic address space.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td> <p><strong>Relative addresses</strong></p> <p>At the time of compilation, a compiler converts symbolic addresses into relative addresses.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td> <p><strong>Physical addresses</strong></p> <p>The loader generates these addresses at the time when a program is loaded into main memory.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Virtual and physical addresses are the same in compile-time and load-time address-binding schemes. Virtual and physical addresses differ in execution-time address-binding scheme.</p> <p>The set of all logical addresses generated by a program is referred to as a&nbsp;<strong>logical address space</strong>. The set of all physical addresses corresponding to these logical addresses is referred to as a&nbsp;<strong>physical address space.</strong></p> <p>The runtime mapping from virtual to physical address is done by the memory management unit (MMU) which is a hardware device. MMU uses following mechanism to convert virtual address to physical address.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The value in the base register is added to every address generated by a user process, which is treated as offset at the time it is sent to memory. For example, if the base register value is 10000, then an attempt by the user to use address location 100 will be dynamically reallocated to location 10100.</p> </li> <li> <p>The user program deals with virtual addresses; it never sees the real physical addresses.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Static vs Dynamic Loading</h2> <p>The choice between Static or Dynamic Loading is to be made at the time of computer program being developed. If you have to load your program statically, then at the time of compilation, the complete programs will be compiled and linked without leaving any external program or module dependency. The linker combines the object program with other necessary object modules into an absolute program, which also includes logical addresses.</p> <p>If you are writing a Dynamically loaded program, then your compiler will compile the program and for all the modules which you want to include dynamically, only references will be provided and rest of the work will be done at the time of execution.</p> <p>At the time of loading, with&nbsp;<strong>static loading</strong>, the absolute program (and data) is loaded into memory in order for execution to start.</p> <p>If you are using&nbsp;<strong>dynamic loading</strong>, dynamic routines of the library are stored on a disk in relocatable form and are loaded into memory only when they are needed by the program.</p> <h2>Static vs Dynamic Linking</h2> <p>As explained above, when static linking is used, the linker combines all other modules needed by a program into a single executable program to avoid any runtime dependency.</p> <p>When dynamic linking is used, it is not required to link the actual module or library with the program, rather a reference to the dynamic module is provided at the time of compilation and linking. Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) in Windows and Shared Objects in Unix are good examples of dynamic libraries.</p> <h2>Swapping</h2> <p>Swapping is a mechanism in which a process can be swapped temporarily out of main memory (or move) to secondary storage (disk) and make that memory available to other processes. At some later time, the system swaps back the process from the secondary storage to main memory.</p> <p>Though performance is usually affected by swapping process but it helps in running multiple and big processes in parallel and that's the reason&nbsp;<strong>Swapping is also known as a technique for memory compaction</strong>.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/process_swapping.jpg\" alt=\"Process Swapping\" /></p> <p>The total time taken by swapping process includes the time it takes to move the entire process to a secondary disk and then to copy the process back to memory, as well as the time the process takes to regain main memory.</p> <p>Let us assume that the user process is of size 2048KB and on a standard hard disk where swapping will take place has a data transfer rate around 1 MB per second. The actual transfer of the 1000K process to or from memory will take</p> <pre class=\"result notranslate\">2048KB / 1024KB per second = 2 seconds = 2000 milliseconds </pre> <p>Now considering in and out time, it will take complete 4000 milliseconds plus other overhead where the process competes to regain main memory.</p> <h2>Memory Allocation</h2> <p>Main memory usually has two partitions &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Low Memory</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Operating system resides in this memory.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>High Memory</strong>&nbsp;&minus; User processes are held in high memory.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Operating system uses the following memory allocation mechanism.</p> <table class=\"table table-bordered\" border=\"1\"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.N.</th> <th>Memory Allocation &amp; Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td> <p><strong>Single-partition allocation</strong></p> <p>In this type of allocation, relocation-register scheme is used to protect user processes from each other, and from changing operating-system code and data. Relocation register contains value of smallest physical address whereas limit register contains range of logical addresses. Each logical address must be less than the limit register.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td> <p><strong>Multiple-partition allocation</strong></p> <p>In this type of allocation, main memory is divided into a number of fixed-sized partitions where each partition should contain only one process. When a partition is free, a process is selected from the input queue and is loaded into the free partition. When the process terminates, the partition becomes available for another process.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2>Fragmentation</h2> <p>As processes are loaded and removed from memory, the free memory space is broken into little pieces. It happens after sometimes that processes cannot be allocated to memory blocks considering their small size and memory blocks remains unused. This problem is known as Fragmentation.</p> <p>Fragmentation is of two types &minus;</p> <table class=\"table table-bordered\" border=\"1\"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.N.</th> <th>Fragmentation &amp; Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td> <p><strong>External fragmentation</strong></p> <p>Total memory space is enough to satisfy a request or to reside a process in it, but it is not contiguous, so it cannot be used.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td> <p><strong>Internal fragmentation</strong></p> <p>Memory block assigned to process is bigger. Some portion of memory is left unused, as it cannot be used by another process.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The following diagram shows how fragmentation can cause waste of memory and a compaction technique can be used to create more free memory out of fragmented memory &minus;</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/memory_fragmentation.jpg\" alt=\"Memory Fragmentation\" /></p> <p>External fragmentation can be reduced by compaction or shuffle memory contents to place all free memory together in one large block. To make compaction feasible, relocation should be dynamic.</p> <p>The internal fragmentation can be reduced by effectively assigning the smallest partition but large enough for the process.</p> <h2>Paging</h2> <p>A computer can address more memory than the amount physically installed on the system. This extra memory is actually called virtual memory and it is a section of a hard that's set up to emulate the computer's RAM. Paging technique plays an important role in implementing virtual memory.</p> <p>Paging is a memory management technique in which process address space is broken into blocks of the same size called&nbsp;<strong>pages</strong>&nbsp;(size is power of 2, between 512 bytes and 8192 bytes). The size of the process is measured in the number of pages.</p> <p>Similarly, main memory is divided into small fixed-sized blocks of (physical) memory called&nbsp;<strong>frames</strong>&nbsp;and the size of a frame is kept the same as that of a page to have optimum utilization of the main memory and to avoid external fragmentation.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/paging.jpg\" alt=\"Paging\" /></p> <h3>Address Translation</h3> <p>Page address is called&nbsp;<strong>logical address</strong>&nbsp;and represented by&nbsp;<strong>page number</strong>and the&nbsp;<strong>offset</strong>.</p> <pre class=\"result notranslate\">Logical Address = Page number + page offset </pre> <p>Frame address is called&nbsp;<strong>physical address</strong>&nbsp;and represented by a&nbsp;<strong>frame number</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>offset</strong>.</p> <pre class=\"result notranslate\">Physical Address = Frame number + page offset </pre> <p>A data structure called&nbsp;<strong>page map table</strong>&nbsp;is used to keep track of the relation between a page of a process to a frame in physical memory.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/page_map_table.jpg\" alt=\"Page Map Table\" /></p> <p>When the system allocates a frame to any page, it translates this logical address into a physical address and create entry into the page table to be used throughout execution of the program.</p> <p>When a process is to be executed, its corresponding pages are loaded into any available memory frames. Suppose you have a program of 8Kb but your memory can accommodate only 5Kb at a given point in time, then the paging concept will come into picture. When a computer runs out of RAM, the operating system (OS) will move idle or unwanted pages of memory to secondary memory to free up RAM for other processes and brings them back when needed by the program.</p> <p>This process continues during the whole execution of the program where the OS keeps removing idle pages from the main memory and write them onto the secondary memory and bring them back when required by the program.</p> <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Paging</h3> <p>Here is a list of advantages and disadvantages of paging &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Paging reduces external fragmentation, but still suffer from internal fragmentation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Paging is simple to implement and assumed as an efficient memory management technique.</p> </li> <li> <p>Due to equal size of the pages and frames, swapping becomes very easy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Page table requires extra memory space, so may not be good for a system having small RAM.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Segmentation</h2> <p>Segmentation is a memory management technique in which each job is divided into several segments of different sizes, one for each module that contains pieces that perform related functions. Each segment is actually a different logical address space of the program.</p> <p>When a process is to be executed, its corresponding segmentation are loaded into non-contiguous memory though every segment is loaded into a contiguous block of available memory.</p> <p>Segmentation memory management works very similar to paging but here segments are of variable-length where as in paging pages are of fixed size.</p> <p>A program segment contains the program's main function, utility functions, data structures, and so on. The operating system maintains a&nbsp;<strong>segment map table</strong>&nbsp;for every process and a list of free memory blocks along with segment numbers, their size and corresponding memory locations in main memory. For each segment, the table stores the starting address of the segment and the length of the segment. A reference to a memory location includes a value that identifies a segment and an offset.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/segment_map_table.jpg\" alt=\"Segment Map Table\" /></p>"

This extra memory is actually called&nbsp;<strong>virtual memory</strong>&nbsp;and it is a section of a hard disk that's set up to emulate the computer's RAM.</p> <p>The main visible advantage of this scheme is that programs can be larger than physical memory. Virtual memory serves two purposes. First, it allows us to extend the use of physical memory by using disk. Second, it allows us to have memory protection, because each virtual address is translated to a physical address.</p> <p>Following are the situations, when entire program is not required to be loaded fully in main memory.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>User written error handling routines are used only when an error occurred in the data or computation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Certain options and features of a program may be used rarely.</p> </li> <li> <p>Many tables are assigned a fixed amount of address space even though only a small amount of the table is actually used.</p> </li> <li> <p>The ability to execute a program that is only partially in memory would counter many benefits.</p> </li> <li> <p>Less number of I/O would be needed to load or swap each user program into memory.</p> </li> <li> <p>A program would no longer be constrained by the amount of physical memory that is available.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each user program could take less physical memory, more programs could be run the same time, with a corresponding increase in CPU utilization and throughput.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Modern microprocessors intended for general-purpose use, a memory management unit, or MMU, is built into the hardware. The MMU's job is to translate virtual addresses into physical addresses. A basic example is given below &minus;</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/virtual_memory.jpg\" alt=\"Virtual Memory\" /></p> <p>Virtual memory is commonly implemented by demand paging. It can also be implemented in a segmentation system. Demand segmentation can also be used to provide virtual memory.</p> <h2>Demand Paging</h2> <p>A demand paging system is quite similar to a paging system with swapping where processes reside in secondary memory and pages are loaded only on demand, not in advance. When a context switch occurs, the operating system does not copy any of the old program&rsquo;s pages out to the disk or any of the new program&rsquo;s pages into the main memory Instead, it just begins executing the new program after loading the first page and fetches that program&rsquo;s pages as they are referenced.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/demand_paging.jpg\" alt=\"Demand Paging\" /></p> <p>While executing a program, if the program references a page which is not available in the main memory because it was swapped out a little ago, the processor treats this invalid memory reference as a&nbsp;<strong>page fault</strong>&nbsp;and transfers control from the program to the operating system to demand the page back into the memory.</p> <h3>Advantages</h3> <p>Following are the advantages of Demand Paging &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Large virtual memory.</li> <li>More efficient use of memory.</li> <li>There is no limit on degree of multiprogramming.</li> </ul> <h3>Disadvantages</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Number of tables and the amount of processor overhead for handling page interrupts are greater than in the case of the simple paged management techniques.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Page Replacement Algorithm</h2> <p>Page replacement algorithms are the techniques using which an Operating System decides which memory pages to swap out, write to disk when a page of memory needs to be allocated. Paging happens whenever a page fault occurs and a free page cannot be used for allocation purpose accounting to reason that pages are not available or the number of free pages is lower than required pages.</p> <p>When the page that was selected for replacement and was paged out, is referenced again, it has to read in from disk, and this requires for I/O completion. This process determines the quality of the page replacement algorithm: the lesser the time waiting for page-ins, the better is the algorithm.</p> <p>A page replacement algorithm looks at the limited information about accessing the pages provided by hardware, and tries to select which pages should be replaced to minimize the total number of page misses, while balancing it with the costs of primary storage and processor time of the algorithm itself. There are many different page replacement algorithms. We evaluate an algorithm by running it on a particular string of memory reference and computing the number of page faults,</p> <h2>Reference String</h2> <p>The string of memory references is called reference string. Reference strings are generated artificially or by tracing a given system and recording the address of each memory reference. The latter choice produces a large number of data, where we note two things.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>For a given page size, we need to consider only the page number, not the entire address.</p> </li> <li> <p>If we have a reference to a page&nbsp;<strong>p</strong>, then any immediately following references to page&nbsp;<strong>p</strong>&nbsp;will never cause a page fault. Page p will be in memory after the first reference; the immediately following references will not fault.</p> </li> <li> <p>For example, consider the following sequence of addresses &minus; 123,215,600,1234,76,96</p> </li> <li> <p>If page size is 100, then the reference string is 1,2,6,12,0,0</p> </li> </ul> <h2>First In First Out (FIFO) algorithm</h2> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Oldest page in main memory is the one which will be selected for replacement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Easy to implement, keep a list, replace pages from the tail and add new pages at the head.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/fifo.jpg\" alt=\"First In First Out\" /></p> <h2>Optimal Page algorithm</h2> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>An optimal page-replacement algorithm has the lowest page-fault rate of all algorithms. An optimal page-replacement algorithm exists, and has been called OPT or MIN.</p> </li> <li> <p>Replace the page that will not be used for the longest period of time. Use the time when a page is to be used.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/opr.jpg\" alt=\"Optimal page replacement\" /></p> <h2>Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm</h2> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Page which has not been used for the longest time in main memory is the one which will be selected for replacement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Easy to implement, keep a list, replace pages by looking back into time.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/lru.jpg\" alt=\"Least Recently Used\" /></p> <h2>Page Buffering algorithm</h2> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>To get a process start quickly, keep a pool of free frames.</li> <li>On page fault, select a page to be replaced.</li> <li>Write the new page in the frame of free pool, mark the page table and restart the process.</li> <li>Now write the dirty page out of disk and place the frame holding replaced page in free pool.</li> </ul> <h2>Least frequently Used(LFU) algorithm</h2> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>The page with the smallest count is the one which will be selected for replacement.</p> </li> <li> <p>This algorithm suffers from the situation in which a page is used heavily during the initial phase of a process, but then is never used again.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Most frequently Used(MFU) algorithm</h2> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>This algorithm is based on the argument that the page with the smallest count was probably just brought in and has yet to be used.</p> </li> </ul>"

            "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Operating System - I/O Hardware</h1> <p>One of the important jobs of an Operating System is to manage various I/O devices including mouse, keyboards, touch pad, disk drives, display adapters, USB devices, Bit-mapped screen, LED, Analog-to-digital converter, On/off switch, network connections, audio I/O, printers etc.</p> <p>An I/O system is required to take an application I/O request and send it to the physical device, then take whatever response comes back from the device and send it to the application. I/O devices can be divided into two categories &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Block devices</strong>&nbsp;&minus; A block device is one with which the driver communicates by sending entire blocks of data. For example, Hard disks, USB cameras, Disk-On-Key etc.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Character devices</strong>&nbsp;&minus; A character device is one with which the driver communicates by sending and receiving single characters (bytes, octets). For example, serial ports, parallel ports, sounds cards etc</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Device Controllers</h2> <p>Device drivers are software modules that can be plugged into an OS to handle a particular device. Operating System takes help from device drivers to handle all I/O devices.</p> <p>The Device Controller works like an interface between a device and a device driver. I/O units (Keyboard, mouse, printer, etc.) typically consist of a mechanical component and an electronic component where electronic component is called the device controller.</p> <p>There is always a device controller and a device driver for each device to communicate with the Operating Systems. A device controller may be able to handle multiple devices. As an interface its main task is to convert serial bit stream to block of bytes, perform error correction as necessary.</p> <p>Any device connected to the computer is connected by a plug and socket, and the socket is connected to a device controller. Following is a model for connecting the CPU, memory, controllers, and I/O devices where CPU and device controllers all use a common bus for communication.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/device_controllers.jpg\" alt=\"Device Controllers\" /></p> <h2>Synchronous vs asynchronous I/O</h2> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Synchronous I/O</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In this scheme CPU execution waits while I/O proceeds</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Asynchronous I/O</strong>&nbsp;&minus; I/O proceeds concurrently with CPU execution</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Communication to I/O Devices</h2> <p>The CPU must have a way to pass information to and from an I/O device. There are three approaches available to communicate with the CPU and Device.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Special Instruction I/O</li> <li>Memory-mapped I/O</li> <li>Direct memory access (DMA)</li> </ul> <h3>Special Instruction I/O</h3> <p>This uses CPU instructions that are specifically made for controlling I/O devices. These instructions typically allow data to be sent to an I/O device or read from an I/O device.</p> <h3>Memory-mapped I/O</h3> <p>When using memory-mapped I/O, the same address space is shared by memory and I/O devices. The device is connected directly to certain main memory locations so that I/O device can transfer block of data to/from memory without going through CPU.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/memory_mapped_io.jpg\" alt=\"Memory-mapped I/O\" /></p> <p>While using memory mapped IO, OS allocates buffer in memory and informs I/O device to use that buffer to send data to the CPU. I/O device operates asynchronously with CPU, interrupts CPU when finished.</p> <p>The advantage to this method is that every instruction which can access memory can be used to manipulate an I/O device. Memory mapped IO is used for most high-speed I/O devices like disks, communication interfaces.</p> <h2>Direct Memory Access (DMA)</h2> <p>Slow devices like keyboards will generate an interrupt to the main CPU after each byte is transferred. If a fast device such as a disk generated an interrupt for each byte, the operating system would spend most of its time handling these interrupts. So a typical computer uses direct memory access (DMA) hardware to reduce this overhead.</p> <p>Direct Memory Access (DMA) means CPU grants I/O module authority to read from or write to memory without involvement. DMA module itself controls exchange of data between main memory and the I/O device. CPU is only involved at the beginning and end of the transfer and interrupted only after entire block has been transferred.</p> <p>Direct Memory Access needs a special hardware called DMA controller (DMAC) that manages the data transfers and arbitrates access to the system bus. The controllers are programmed with source and destination pointers (where to read/write the data), counters to track the number of transferred bytes, and settings, which includes I/O and memory types, interrupts and states for the CPU cycles.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/dma.jpg\" alt=\"DMA\" /></p> <p>The operating system uses the DMA hardware as follows &minus;</p> <table class=\"table table-bordered\" border=\"1\"> <tbody> <tr> <th>Step</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Device driver is instructed to transfer disk data to a buffer address X.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Device driver then instruct disk controller to transfer data to buffer.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>Disk controller starts DMA transfer.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Disk controller sends each byte to DMA controller.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>DMA controller transfers bytes to buffer, increases the memory address, decreases the counter C until C becomes zero.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>When C becomes zero, DMA interrupts CPU to signal transfer completion.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2>Polling vs Interrupts I/O</h2> <p>A computer must have a way of detecting the arrival of any type of input. There are two ways that this can happen, known as&nbsp;<strong>polling</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>interrupts</strong>. Both of these techniques allow the processor to deal with events that can happen at any time and that are not related to the process it is currently running.</p> <h3>Polling I/O</h3> <p>Polling is the simplest way for an I/O device to communicate with the processor. The process of periodically checking status of the device to see if it is time for the next I/O operation, is called polling. The I/O device simply puts the information in a Status register, and the processor must come and get the information.</p> <p>Most of the time, devices will not require attention and when one does it will have to wait until it is next interrogated by the polling program. This is an inefficient method and much of the processors time is wasted on unnecessary polls.</p> <p>Compare this method to a teacher continually asking every student in a class, one after another, if they need help. Obviously the more efficient method would be for a student to inform the teacher whenever they require assistance.</p> <h3>Interrupts I/O</h3> <p>An alternative scheme for dealing with I/O is the interrupt-driven method. An interrupt is a signal to the microprocessor from a device that requires attention.</p> <p>A device controller puts an interrupt signal on the bus when it needs CPU&rsquo;s attention when CPU receives an interrupt, It saves its current state and invokes the appropriate interrupt handler using the interrupt vector (addresses of OS routines to handle various events). When the interrupting device has been dealt with, the CPU continues with its original task as if it had never been interrupted.</p>"

            "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Operating System - I/O Softwares</h1> <p>I/O software is often organized in the following layers &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>User Level Libraries</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This provides simple interface to the user program to perform input and output. For example,&nbsp;<strong>stdio</strong>&nbsp;is a library provided by C and C++ programming languages.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Kernel Level Modules</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This provides device driver to interact with the device controller and device independent I/O modules used by the device drivers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hardware</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This layer includes actual hardware and hardware controller which interact with the device drivers and makes hardware alive.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A key concept in the design of I/O software is that it should be device independent where it should be possible to write programs that can access any I/O device without having to specify the device in advance. For example, a program that reads a file as input should be able to read a file on a floppy disk, on a hard disk, or on a CD-ROM, without having to modify the program for each different device.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/io_software.jpg\" alt=\"I/O Softwares\" /></p> <h2>Device Drivers</h2> <p>Device drivers are software modules that can be plugged into an OS to handle a particular device. Operating System takes help from device drivers to handle all I/O devices. Device drivers encapsulate device-dependent code and implement a standard interface in such a way that code contains device-specific register reads/writes. Device driver, is generally written by the device's manufacturer and delivered along with the device on a CD-ROM.</p> <p>A device driver performs the following jobs &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>To accept request from the device independent software above to it.</li> <li>Interact with the device controller to take and give I/O and perform required error handling</li> <li>Making sure that the request is executed successfully</li> </ul> <p>How a device driver handles a request is as follows: Suppose a request comes to read a block N. If the driver is idle at the time a request arrives, it starts carrying out the request immediately. Otherwise, if the driver is already busy with some other request, it places the new request in the queue of pending requests.</p> <h2>Interrupt handlers</h2> <p>An interrupt handler, also known as an interrupt service routine or ISR, is a piece of software or more specifically a callback function in an operating system or more specifically in a device driver, whose execution is triggered by the reception of an interrupt.</p> <p>When the interrupt happens, the interrupt procedure does whatever it has to in order to handle the interrupt, updates data structures and wakes up process that was waiting for an interrupt to happen.</p> <p>The interrupt mechanism accepts an address ─ a number that selects a specific interrupt handling routine/function from a small set. In most architectures, this address is an offset stored in a table called the interrupt vector table. This vector contains the memory addresses of specialized interrupt handlers.</p> <h2>Device-Independent I/O Software</h2> <p>The basic function of the device-independent software is to perform the I/O functions that are common to all devices and to provide a uniform interface to the user-level software. Though it is difficult to write completely device independent software but we can write some modules which are common among all the devices. Following is a list of functions of device-independent I/O Software &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Uniform interfacing for device drivers</li> <li>Device naming - Mnemonic names mapped to Major and Minor device numbers</li> <li>Device protection</li> <li>Providing a device-independent block size</li> <li>Buffering because data coming off a device cannot be stored in final destination.</li> <li>Storage allocation on block devices</li> <li>Allocation and releasing dedicated devices</li> <li>Error Reporting</li> </ul> <h2>User-Space I/O Software</h2> <p>These are the libraries which provide richer and simplified interface to access the functionality of the kernel or ultimately interactive with the device drivers. Most of the user-level I/O software consists of library procedures with some exception like spooling system which is a way of dealing with dedicated I/O devices in a multiprogramming system.</p> <p>I/O Libraries (e.g., stdio) are in user-space to provide an interface to the OS resident device-independent I/O SW. For example putchar(), getchar(), printf() and scanf() are example of user level I/O library stdio available in C programming.</p> <h2>Kernel I/O Subsystem</h2> <p>Kernel I/O Subsystem is responsible to provide many services related to I/O. Following are some of the services provided.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Scheduling</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Kernel schedules a set of I/O requests to determine a good order in which to execute them. When an application issues a blocking I/O system call, the request is placed on the queue for that device. The Kernel I/O scheduler rearranges the order of the queue to improve the overall system efficiency and the average response time experienced by the applications.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Buffering</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Kernel I/O Subsystem maintains a memory area known as&nbsp;<strong>buffer</strong>&nbsp;that stores data while they are transferred between two devices or between a device with an application operation. Buffering is done to cope with a speed mismatch between the producer and consumer of a data stream or to adapt between devices that have different data transfer sizes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Caching</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Kernel maintains cache memory which is region of fast memory that holds copies of data. Access to the cached copy is more efficient than access to the original.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Spooling and Device Reservation</strong>&nbsp;&minus; A spool is a buffer that holds output for a device, such as a printer, that cannot accept interleaved data streams. The spooling system copies the queued spool files to the printer one at a time. In some operating systems, spooling is managed by a system daemon process. In other operating systems, it is handled by an in kernel thread.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Error Handling</strong>&nbsp;&minus; An operating system that uses protected memory can guard against many kinds of hardware and application errors.</p> </li> </ul>"

In general, a file is a sequence of bits, bytes, lines or records whose meaning is defined by the files creator and user.</p> <h2>File Structure</h2> <p>A File Structure should be according to a required format that the operating system can understand.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>A file has a certain defined structure according to its type.</p> </li> <li> <p>A text file is a sequence of characters organized into lines.</p> </li> <li> <p>A source file is a sequence of procedures and functions.</p> </li> <li> <p>An object file is a sequence of bytes organized into blocks that are understandable by the machine.</p> </li> <li> <p>When operating system defines different file structures, it also contains the code to support these file structure. Unix, MS-DOS support minimum number of file structure.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>File Type</h2> <p>File type refers to the ability of the operating system to distinguish different types of file such as text files source files and binary files etc. Many operating systems support many types of files. Operating system like MS-DOS and UNIX have the following types of files &minus;</p> <h3>Ordinary files</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>These are the files that contain user information.</li> <li>These may have text, databases or executable program.</li> <li>The user can apply various operations on such files like add, modify, delete or even remove the entire file.</li> </ul> <h3>Directory files</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>These files contain list of file names and other information related to these files.</li> </ul> <h3>Special files</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>These files are also known as device files.</li> <li>These files represent physical device like disks, terminals, printers, networks, tape drive etc.</li> </ul> <p>These files are of two types &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Character special files</strong>&nbsp;&minus; data is handled character by character as in case of terminals or printers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Block special files</strong>&nbsp;&minus; data is handled in blocks as in the case of disks and tapes.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>File Access Mechanisms</h2> <p>File access mechanism refers to the manner in which the records of a file may be accessed. There are several ways to access files &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Sequential access</li> <li>Direct/Random access</li> <li>Indexed sequential access</li> </ul> <h3>Sequential access</h3> <p>A sequential access is that in which the records are accessed in some sequence, i.e., the information in the file is processed in order, one record after the other. This access method is the most primitive one. Example: Compilers usually access files in this fashion.</p> <h3>Direct/Random access</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Random access file organization provides, accessing the records directly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each record has its own address on the file with by the help of which it can be directly accessed for reading or writing.</p> </li> <li> <p>The records need not be in any sequence within the file and they need not be in adjacent locations on the storage medium.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Indexed sequential access</h3> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>This mechanism is built up on base of sequential access.</li> <li>An index is created for each file which contains pointers to various blocks.</li> <li>Index is searched sequentially and its pointer is used to access the file directly.</li> </ul> <h2>Space Allocation</h2> <p>Files are allocated disk spaces by operating system.

            "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Operating System - Security</h1> <p>Security refers to providing a protection system to computer system resources such as CPU, memory, disk, software programs and most importantly data/information stored in the computer system. If a computer program is run by an unauthorized user, then he/she may cause severe damage to computer or data stored in it. So a computer system must be protected against unauthorized access, malicious access to system memory, viruses, worms etc. We're going to discuss following topics in this chapter.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Authentication</li> <li>One Time passwords</li> <li>Program Threats</li> <li>System Threats</li> <li>Computer Security Classifications</li> </ul> <h2>Authentication</h2> <p>Authentication refers to identifying each user of the system and associating the executing programs with those users. It is the responsibility of the Operating System to create a protection system which ensures that a user who is running a particular program is authentic. Operating Systems generally identifies/authenticates users using following three ways &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Username / Password</strong>&nbsp;&minus; User need to enter a registered username and password with Operating system to login into the system.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>User card/key</strong>&nbsp;&minus; User need to punch card in card slot, or enter key generated by key generator in option provided by operating system to login into the system.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>User attribute - fingerprint/ eye retina pattern/ signature</strong>&nbsp;&minus; User need to pass his/her attribute via designated input device used by operating system to login into the system.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>One Time passwords</h2> <p>One-time passwords provide additional security along with normal authentication. In One-Time Password system, a unique password is required every time user tries to login into the system. Once a one-time password is used, then it cannot be used again. One-time password are implemented in various ways.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Random numbers</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Users are provided cards having numbers printed along with corresponding alphabets. System asks for numbers corresponding to few alphabets randomly chosen.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Secret key</strong>&nbsp;&minus; User are provided a hardware device which can create a secret id mapped with user id. System asks for such secret id which is to be generated every time prior to login.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Network password</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Some commercial applications send one-time passwords to user on registered mobile/ email which is required to be entered prior to login.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Program Threats</h2> <p>Operating system's processes and kernel do the designated task as instructed. If a user program made these process do malicious tasks, then it is known as&nbsp;<strong>Program Threats</strong>. One of the common example of program threat is a program installed in a computer which can store and send user credentials via network to some hacker. Following is the list of some well-known program threats.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Trojan Horse</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Such program traps user login credentials and stores them to send to malicious user who can later on login to computer and can access system resources.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trap Door</strong>&nbsp;&minus; If a program which is designed to work as required, have a security hole in its code and perform illegal action without knowledge of user then it is called to have a trap door.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Logic Bomb</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Logic bomb is a situation when a program misbehaves only when certain conditions met otherwise it works as a genuine program. It is harder to detect.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Virus</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Virus as name suggest can replicate themselves on computer system. They are highly dangerous and can modify/delete user files, crash systems. A virus is generatlly a small code embedded in a program. As user accesses the program, the virus starts getting embedded in other files/ programs and can make system unusable for user</p> </li> </ul> <h2>System Threats</h2> <p>System threats refers to misuse of system services and network connections to put user in trouble. System threats can be used to launch program threats on a complete network called as program attack. System threats creates such an environment that operating system resources/ user files are misused. Following is the list of some well-known system threats.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Worm</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Worm is a process which can choked down a system performance by using system resources to extreme levels. A Worm process generates its multiple copies where each copy uses system resources, prevents all other processes to get required resources. Worms processes can even shut down an entire network.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Port Scanning</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Port scanning is a mechanism or means by which a hacker can detects system vulnerabilities to make an attack on the system.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Denial of Service</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Denial of service attacks normally prevents user to make legitimate use of the system. For example, a user may not be able to use internet if denial of service attacks browser's content settings.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Computer Security Classifications</h2> <p>As per the U.S. Department of Defense Trusted Computer System's Evaluation Criteria there are four security classifications in computer systems: A, B, C, and D. This is widely used specifications to determine and model the security of systems and of security solutions. Following is the brief description of each classification.</p> <table class=\"table table-bordered\" border=\"1\"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.N.</th> <th>Classification Type &amp; Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td> <p><strong>Type A</strong></p> <p>Highest Level. Uses formal design specifications and verification techniques. Grants a high degree of assurance of process security.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td> <p><strong>Type B</strong></p> <p>Provides mandatory protection system. Have all the properties of a class C2 system. Attaches a sensitivity label to each object. It is of three types.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>B1</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Maintains the security label of each object in the system. Label is used for making decisions to access control.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>B2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Extends the sensitivity labels to each system resource, such as storage objects, supports covert channels and auditing of events.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>B3</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Allows creating lists or user groups for access-control to grant access or revoke access to a given named object.</p> </li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td> <p><strong>Type C</strong></p> <p>Provides protection and user accountability using audit capabilities. It is of two types.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>C1</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Incorporates controls so that users can protect their private information and keep other users from accidentally reading / deleting their data. UNIX versions are mostly Cl class.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>C2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Adds an individual-level access control to the capabilities of a Cl level system.</p> </li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td> <p><strong>Type D</strong></p> <p>Lowest level. Minimum protection. MS-DOS, Window 3.1 fall in this category.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>"

Because of this absence of any 'physical infrastructure', wireless communication has certain advantages. This would often include collapsing distance or space.</p> <p>Wireless communication has several advantages; the most important ones are discussed below &minus;</p> <h3>Cost-effectiveness</h3> <p>Wired communication entails the use of connection wires. In wireless networks, communication does not require elaborate physical infrastructure or maintenance practices. Hence the cost is reduced.</p> <p><strong>Example</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Any company providing wireless communication services does not incur a lot of costs, and as a result, it is able to charge cheaply with regard to its customer fees.</p> <h3>Flexibility</h3> <p>Wireless communication enables people to communicate regardless of their location. It is not necessary to be in an office or some telephone booth in order to pass and receive messages.</p> <p>Miners in the outback can rely on satellite phones to call their loved ones, and thus, help improve their general welfare by keeping them in touch with the people who mean the most to them.</p> <h3>Convenience</h3> <p>Wireless communication devices like mobile phones are quite simple and therefore allow anyone to use them, wherever they may be. There is no need to physically connect anything in order to receive or pass messages.</p> <p><strong>Example</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Wireless communications services can also be seen in Internet technologies such as Wi-Fi. With no network cables hampering movement, we can now connect with almost anyone, anywhere, anytime.</p> <h3>Speed</h3> <p>Improvements can also be seen in speed. The network connectivity or accessibility were much improved in accuracy and speed.</p> <p><strong>Example</strong>&nbsp;&minus; A wireless remote can operate a system faster than a wired one. The wireless control of a machine can easily stop its working if something goes wrong, whereas direct operation can&rsquo;t act so fast.</p> <h3>Accessibility</h3> <p>The wireless technology helps easy accessibility as the remote areas where ground lines can&rsquo;t be properly laid, are being easily connected to the network.</p> <p><strong>Example</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In rural regions, online education is now possible. Educators no longer need to travel to far-flung areas to teach their lessons. Thanks to live streaming of their educational modules.</p> <h3>Constant connectivity</h3> <p>Constant connectivity also ensures that people can respond to emergencies relatively quickly.</p> <p><strong>Example</strong>&nbsp;&minus; A wireless mobile can ensure you constant connectivity though you move from place to place or while you travel, whereas a wired landline can&rsquo;t.</p>"

            "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Wireless Communication - Multiple Access</h1> <p>Multiple access schemes are used to allow many mobile users to share simultaneously a finite amount of radio spectrum.</p> <h2>Multiple Access Techniques</h2> <p>In wireless communication systems, it is often desirable to allow the subscriber to send information simultaneously from the mobile station to the base station while receiving information from the base station to the mobile station.</p> <p>A cellular system divides any given area into cells where a mobile unit in each cell communicates with a base station. The main aim in the cellular system design is to be able to&nbsp;<strong>increase the capacity of the channel</strong>, i.e., to handle as many calls as possible in a given bandwidth with a sufficient level of quality of service.</p> <p>There are several different ways to allow access to the channel. These includes mainly the following &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Frequency division multiple-access (FDMA)</li> <li>Time division multiple-access (TDMA)</li> <li>Code division multiple-access (CDMA)</li> <li>Space division multiple access (SDMA)</li> </ul> <p>Depending on how the available bandwidth is allocated to the users, these techniques can be classified as&nbsp;<strong>narrowband</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>wideband</strong>&nbsp;systems.</p> <h3>Narrowband Systems</h3> <p>Systems operating with channels substantially narrower than the coherence bandwidth are called as Narrow band systems. Narrow band TDMA allows users to use the same channel but allocates a unique time slot to each user on the channel, thus separating a small number of users in time on a single channel.</p> <h3>Wideband Systems</h3> <p>In wideband systems, the transmission bandwidth of a single channel is much larger than the coherence bandwidth of the channel. Thus, multipath fading doesn&rsquo;t greatly affect the received signal within a wideband channel, and frequency selective fades occur only in a small fraction of the signal bandwidth.</p> <h2>Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)</h2> <p>FDMA is the basic technology for advanced mobile phone services. The features of FDMA are as follows.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>FDMA allots a different sub-band of frequency to each different user to access the network.</li> <li>If FDMA is not in use, the channel is left idle instead of allotting to the other users.</li> <li>FDMA is implemented in Narrowband systems and it is less complex than TDMA.</li> <li>Tight filtering is done here to reduce adjacent channel interference.</li> <li>The base station BS and mobile station MS, transmit and receive simultaneously and continuously in FDMA.</li> </ul> <h2>Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)</h2> <p>In the cases where continuous transmission is not required, there TDMA is used instead of FDMA. The features of TDMA include the following.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>TDMA shares a single carrier frequency with several users where each users makes use of non-overlapping time slots.</li> <li>Data transmission in TDMA is not continuous, but occurs in bursts. Hence handsoff process is simpler.</li> <li>TDMA uses different time slots for transmission and reception thus duplexers are not required.</li> <li>TDMA has an advantage that is possible to allocate different numbers of time slots per frame to different users.</li> <li>Bandwidth can be supplied on demand to different users by concatenating or reassigning time slot based on priority.</li> </ul> <h2>Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)</h2> <p>Code division multiple access technique is an example of multiple access where several transmitters use a single channel to send information simultaneously. Its features are as follows.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>In CDMA every user uses the full available spectrum instead of getting allotted by separate frequency.</li> <li>CDMA is much recommended for voice and data communications.</li> <li>While multiple codes occupy the same channel in CDMA, the users having same code can communicate with each other.</li> <li>CDMA offers more air-space capacity than TDMA.</li> <li>The hands-off between base stations is very well handled by CDMA.</li> </ul> <h2>Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA)</h2> <p>Space division multiple access or spatial division multiple access is a technique which is MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) architecture and used mostly in wireless and satellite communication. It has the following features.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>All users can communicate at the same time using the same channel.</li> <li>SDMA is completely free from interference.</li> <li>A single satellite can communicate with more satellites receivers of the same frequency.</li> <li>The directional spot-beam antennas are used and hence the base station in SDMA, can track a moving user.</li> <li>Controls the radiated energy for each user in space.</li> </ul> <h2>Spread Spectrum Multiple Access</h2> <p>Spread spectrum multiple access (SSMA) uses signals which have a transmission bandwidth whose magnitude is greater than the minimum required RF bandwidth.</p> <p>There are two main types of spread spectrum multiple access techniques &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Frequency hopped spread spectrum (FHSS)</li> <li>Direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)</li> </ul> <h3>Frequency Hopped Spread Spectrum (FHSS)</h3> <p>This is a digital multiple access system in which the carrier frequencies of the individual users are varied in a pseudo random fashion within a wideband channel. The digital data is broken into uniform sized bursts which is then transmitted on different carrier frequencies.</p> <h3>Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)</h3> <p>This is the most commonly used technology for CDMA. In DS-SS, the message signal is multiplied by a Pseudo Random Noise Code. Each user is given his own code word which is orthogonal to the codes of other users and in order to detect the user, the receiver must know the code word used by the transmitter.</p> <p>The combinational sequences called as&nbsp;<strong>hybrid</strong>&nbsp;are also used as another type of spread spectrum.&nbsp;<strong>Time hopping</strong>&nbsp;is also another type which is rarely mentioned.</p> <p>Since many users can share the same spread spectrum bandwidth without interfering with one another, spread spectrum systems become&nbsp;<strong>bandwidth efficient</strong>&nbsp;in a multiple user environment.</p>"

            "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Channel Characteristics</h1> <p>The wireless channel is susceptible to a variety of transmission impediments such as&nbsp;<strong>path loss, interference</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>blockage</strong>. These factors restrict the range, data rate, and the reliability of the wireless transmission.</p> <h2>Types of Paths</h2> <p>The extent to which these factors affect the transmission depends upon the environmental conditions and the mobility of the transmitter and receiver. The path followed by the signals to get to the receiver, are two types, such as &minus;</p> <h3>Direct-path</h3> <p>The transmitted signal, when reaches the receiver directly, can be termed as a&nbsp;<strong>directpath</strong>&nbsp;and the components presents that are present in the signal are called as&nbsp;<strong>directpath components</strong>.</p> <h3>Multi-path</h3> <p>The transmitted signal when reaches the receiver, through different directions undergoing different phenomenon, such a path is termed as&nbsp;<strong>multi-path</strong>&nbsp;and the components of the transmitted signal are called as&nbsp;<strong>multi-path components</strong>.</p> <p>They are reflected, diffracted and scattered by the environment, and arrive at the receiver shifted in amplitude, frequency and phase with respect to the direct path component.</p> <h2>Characteristics of Wireless Channel</h2> <p>The most important characteristics of wireless channel are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Path loss</li> <li>Fading</li> <li>Interference</li> <li>Doppler shift</li> </ul> <p>In the following sections, we will discuss these channel characteristics one by one.</p> <h2>Path Loss</h2> <p>Path loss can be expressed as the ratio of the power of the transmitted signal to the power of the same signal received by the receiver, on a given path. It is a function of the propagation distance.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Estimation of path loss is very important for designing and deploying wireless communication networks</p> </li> <li> <p>Path loss is dependent on a number of factors such as the radio frequency used and the nature of the terrain.</p> </li> <li> <p>The free space propagation model is the simplest path loss model in which there is a direct-path signal between the transmitter and the receiver, with no atmosphere attenuation or multipath components.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this model, the relationship between the transmitted power&nbsp;<strong><em>P<sub>t</sub></em></strong>&nbsp;and the received power&nbsp;<strong><em>P<sub>r</sub></em></strong>&nbsp;is given by</p> <h3 class=\"MathJax_Display\">Pr=PGtGr(&lambda;/4&Pi;d)2</h3> <p>Where</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>G<sub>t</sub></strong>&nbsp;is the transmitter antenna gain</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>G<sub>r</sub></strong>&nbsp;is the receiver antenna gain</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>d</strong>&nbsp;is the distance between the transmitter and receiver</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>&lambda;</strong>&nbsp;is the wavelength of the signal</p> </li> </ul> <p>Two-way model also called as two path models is widely used path loss model. The free space model described above assumes that there is only one single path from the transmitter to the receiver.</p> <p>In reality, the signal reaches the receiver through multiple paths. The two path model tries to capture this phenomenon. The model assumes that the signal reaches the receiver through two paths, one a line-of-sight and the other the path through which the reflected wave is received.</p> <p>According to the two-path model, the received power is given by</p> <h3 class=\"MathJax_Display\">Pr=PtGtGr(hthr/d2)2</h3> <p>Where</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>p<sub>t</sub></strong>&nbsp;is the transmitted power</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>G<sub>t</sub></strong>&nbsp;represent the antenna gain at the transmitter</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>G<sub>r</sub></strong>&nbsp;represent the antenna gain at the receiver</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>d</strong>&nbsp;is the distance between the transmitter and receiver</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>h<sub>t</sub></strong>&nbsp;is the height of the transmitter</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>h<sub>r</sub></strong>&nbsp;are the height of the receiver</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Fading</h2> <p>Fading refers to the fluctuations in signal strength when received at the receiver. Fading can be classified in to two types &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Fast fading/small scale fading and</li> <li>Slow fading/large scale fading</li> </ul> <p>Fast fading refers to the rapid fluctuations in the amplitude, phase or multipath delays of the received signal, due to the interference between multiple versions of the same transmitted signal arriving at the receiver at slightly different times.</p> <p>The time between the reception of the first version of the signal and the last echoed signal is called&nbsp;<strong>delay spread</strong>. The multipath propagation of the transmitted signal, which causes fast fading, is because of the three propagation mechanisms, namely &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Reflection</li> <li>Diffraction</li> <li>Scattering</li> </ul> <p>The multiple signal paths may sometimes add constructively or sometimes destructively at the receiver causing a variation in the power level of the received signal. The received single envelope of a fast fading signal is said to follow a&nbsp;<strong>Rayleigh distribution</strong>&nbsp;to see if there is no line-of-sight path between the transmitter and the receiver.</p> <h3>Slow Fading</h3> <p>The name Slow Fading itself implies that the signal fades away slowly. The features of slow fading are as given below.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p>Slow fading occurs when objects that partially absorb the transmission lie between the transmitter and receiver.</p> </li> <li> <p>Slow fading is so called because the duration of the fade may last for multiple seconds or minutes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Slow fading may occur when the receiver is inside a building and the radio wave must pass through the walls of a building, or when the receiver is temporarily shielded from the transmitter by a building. The obstructing objects cause a random variation in the received signal power.</p> </li> <li> <p>Slow fading may cause the received signal power to vary, though the distance between the transmitter and receiver remains the same.</p> </li> <li> <p>Slow fading is also referred to as&nbsp;<strong>shadow fading</strong>&nbsp;since the objects that cause the fade, which may be large buildings or other structures, block the direct transmission path from the transmitter to the receiver.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Interference</h2> <p>Wireless transmissions have to counter interference from a wide variety of sources. Two main forms of interference are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Adjacent channel interference and</li> <li>Co-channel interference.</li> </ul> <p>In Adjacent channel interference case, signals in nearby frequencies have components outside their allocated ranges, and these components may interfere with on-going transmission in the adjacent frequencies. It can be avoided by carefully introducing guard bands between the allocated frequency ranges.</p> <p><strong>Co-channel interference</strong>, sometimes also referred to as&nbsp;<strong>narrow band interference</strong>, is due to other nearby systems using the same transmission frequency.</p> <p><strong>Inter-symbol interference</strong>&nbsp;is another type of interference, where distortion in the received signal is caused by the temporal spreading and the consequent overlapping of individual pulses in the signal.</p> <p><strong>Adaptive equalization</strong>&nbsp;is a commonly used technique for combating inter symbol interference. It involves gathering the dispersed symbol energy into its original time interval. Complex digital processing algorithms are used in the equalization process.</p>"

            "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Propagation Losses</h1> <p>Antenna and Wave propagation plays a vital role in wireless communication networks. An antenna is an electrical conductor or a system of conductors that radiates/collects (transmits or receives) electromagnetic energy into/from space. An idealized isotropic antenna radiates equally in all directions.</p> <h2>Propagation Mechanisms</h2> <p>Wireless transmissions propagate in three modes. They are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Ground-wave propagation</li> <li>Sky-wave propagation</li> <li>Line-of-sight propagation</li> </ul> <p><strong>Ground wave propagation</strong>&nbsp;follows the contour of the earth, while&nbsp;<strong>sky wave propagation</strong>&nbsp;uses reflection by both earth and ionosphere.</p> <p><strong>Line of sight propagation</strong>&nbsp;requires the transmitting and receiving antennas to be within the line of sight of each other. Depending upon the frequency of the underlying signal, the particular mode of propagation is followed.</p> <p>Examples of ground wave and sky wave communication are&nbsp;<strong>AM radio</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>international broadcasts</strong>&nbsp;such as BBC. Above 30 MHz, neither ground wave nor sky wave propagation operates and the communication is through line of sight.</p> <h2>Transmission Limitations</h2> <p>In this section, we will discuss the various limitations that affect electromagnetic wave transmissions. Let us start with attenuation.</p> <h3>Attenuation</h3> <p>The strength of signal falls with distance over transmission medium. The extent of attenuation is a function of distance, transmission medium, as well as the frequency of the underlying transmission.</p> <h3>Distortion</h3> <p>Since signals at different frequencies attenuate to different extents, a signal comprising of components over a range of frequencies gets distorted, i.e., the shape of the received signal changes.</p> <p>A standard method of resolving this problem (and recovering the original shape) is to amplify higher frequencies and thus equalize attenuation over a band of frequencies.</p> <h3>Dispersion</h3> <p>Dispersion is the phenomenon of spreading of a burst of electromagnetic energy during propagation. Bursts of data sent in rapid succession tend to merge due to dispersion.</p> <h3>Noise</h3> <p>The most pervasive form of noise is thermal noise, which is often modeled using an additive Gaussian model. Thermal noise is due to thermal agitation of electrons and is uniformly distributed across the frequency spectrum.</p> <p>Other forms of noise include &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Inter modulation noise</strong>&nbsp;(caused by signals produced at frequencies that are sums or differences of carrier frequencies)</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Crosstalk</strong>&nbsp;(interference between two signals)</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Impulse noise</strong>&nbsp;(irregular pulses of high energy caused by external electromagnetic disturbances).</p> </li> </ul> <p>While an impulse noise may not have a significant impact on analog data, it has a noticeable effect on digital data, causing&nbsp;<strong>burst errors</strong>.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/wireless_communication/images/burst_error.jpg\" alt=\"Burst Error\" /></p> <p>The above figure clearly illustrates how the noise signal overlaps the original signal and tries to change its characteristics.</p> <h3>Fading</h3> <p>Fading refers to the variation of the signal strength with respect to time/distance and is widely prevalent in wireless transmissions. The most common causes of fading in the wireless environment are multipath propagation and mobility (of objects as well as the communicating devices).</p> <h3>Multipath propagation</h3> <p>In wireless media, signals propagate using three principles, which are reflection, scattering, and diffraction.</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>Reflection</strong>&nbsp;occurs when the signal encounters a large solid surface, whose size is much larger than the wavelength of the signal, e.g., a solid wall.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Diffraction</strong>&nbsp;occurs when the signal encounters an edge or a corner, whose size is larger than the wavelength of the signal, e.g., an edge of a wall.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Scattering</strong>&nbsp;occurs when the signal encounters small objects of size smaller than the wavelength of the signal.</p> </li> </ul> <p>One consequence of multipath propagation is that multiple copies of a signal propagation along multiple different paths, arrive at any point at different times. So the signal received at a point is not only affected by the&nbsp;<strong>inherent noise, distortion, attenuation</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>dispersion</strong>&nbsp;in the channel but also the&nbsp;<strong>interaction of signals</strong>&nbsp;propagated along multiple paths.</p> <h3>Delay spread</h3> <p>Suppose we transmit a probing pulse from a location and measure the received signal at the recipient location as a function of time. The signal power of the received signal spreads over time due to multipath propagation.</p> <p>The delay spread is determined by the density function of the resulting spread of the delay over time.&nbsp;<strong>Average delay spread</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>root mean square delay spread</strong>&nbsp;are the two parameters that can be calculated.</p> <h3>Doppler spread</h3> <p>This is a measure of&nbsp;<strong>spectral broadening</strong>&nbsp;caused by the rate of change of the mobile radio channel. It is caused by either relative motion between the mobile and base station or by the movement of objects in the channel.</p> <p>When the velocity of the mobile is high, the Doppler spread is high, and the resulting channel variations are faster than that of the baseband signal, this is referred to as&nbsp;<strong>fast fading</strong>. When channel variations are slower than the baseband signal variations, then the resulting fading is referred to as&nbsp;<strong>slow fading</strong>.</p>"

            "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Wireless Communication - Techniques</h1> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In some cases, there is a scope of performance deterioration, which affects the output. The major cause for this might be the mobile channel impairments. To resolve this, there are three popular techniques &minus;</p> <h3>Equalizer</h3> <p>An equalizer within a receiver compensates for the average range of expected channel amplitude and delay characteristics. In other words, an equalizer is a filter at the mobile receiver whose impulse response is inverse of the channel impulse response. Such equalizers find their use in&nbsp;<strong>frequency selective fading</strong>&nbsp;channels.</p> <h3>Diversity</h3> <p>Diversity is another technique used to compensate&nbsp;<strong>fast fading</strong>&nbsp;and is usually implemented using two or more receiving antennas. It is usually employed to reduce the depths and duration of the fades experienced by a receiver in a flat fading channel.</p> <h3>Channel Coding</h3> <p><strong>Channel coding</strong>&nbsp;improves mobile communication link performance by adding redundant data bits in the transmitted message. At the baseband portion of the transmitter, a channel coder maps a digital message sequence in to another specific code sequence containing greater number of bits than original contained in the message. Channel Coding is used to correct&nbsp;<strong>deep fading</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>spectral null</strong>.</p> <h2>Equalization</h2> <p>ISI (Inter Symbol Interference) has been identified as one of the major obstacles to high speed data transmission over mobile radio channels. If the modulation bandwidth exceeds the&nbsp;<strong>coherence bandwidth</strong>&nbsp;of the radio channel (i.e., frequency selective fading), modulation pulses are spread in time, causing ISI.</p> <p>An equalizer at the front end of a receiver compensates for the average range of expected channel amplitude and delay characteristics. As the mobile fading channels are&nbsp;<strong>random</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>time varying</strong>, equalizers must track the time-varying characteristics of the mobile channel and therefore should be time varying or adaptive. An adaptive equalizer has two phases of operation:&nbsp;<strong>training</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>tracking</strong>.</p> <h3>Training Mode</h3> <p>Initially a known, fixed length training sequence is sent by the transmitter so that the receiver equalizer may average to a proper setting.&nbsp;<strong>Training sequence</strong>&nbsp;is typically a pseudo-random binary signal or a fixed, of prescribed bit pattern.</p> <p>The training sequence is designed to permit an equalizer at the receiver to acquire the&nbsp;<strong>proper filter coefficient</strong>&nbsp;in the worst possible channel condition. An adaptive filter at the receiver thus uses a&nbsp;<strong>recursive algorithm</strong>&nbsp;to evaluate the channel and estimate filter coefficients to compensate for the channel.</p> <h3>Tracking Mode</h3> <p>When the training sequence is finished the filter coefficients are near optimal. Immediately following the training sequence, user data is sent.</p> <p>When the data of the users are received, the&nbsp;<strong>adaptive algorithms&nbsp;</strong>of the equalizer tracks the changing channel. As a result, the adaptive equalizer continuously changes the filter characteristics over time.</p> <h2>Diversity</h2> <p>Diversity is a powerful communication receiver technique that provides wireless link improvement at a relatively low cost.&nbsp;<strong>Diversity techniques</strong>&nbsp;are used in wireless communications systems to primarily to improve performance over a fading radio channel.</p> <p>In such a system, the receiver is provided with multiple copies of the same information signal which are transmitted over two or more real or virtual communication channels. Thus the basic idea of diversity is&nbsp;<strong>repetition</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>redundancy of information</strong>. In virtually all the applications, the diversity decisions are made by the receiver and are unknown to the transmitter.</p> <h3>Types of Diversity</h3> <p>Fading can be classified into&nbsp;<strong>small scale</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>large scale fading</strong>. Small-scale fades are characterized by deep and rapid amplitude fluctuations which occur as the mobile moves over distances of just a few wavelengths. For narrow-band signals, this typically results in a&nbsp;<strong>Rayleigh faded envelope</strong>. In order to prevent deep fades from occurring, microscopic diversity techniques can exploit the rapidly changing signal.</p> <p>If the antenna elements of the receiver are separated by a fraction of the transmitted wavelength, then the various copies of the information signal or generically termed as branches, can be combined suitably or the strongest of them can be chosen as the received signal. Such a diversity technique is termed as&nbsp;<strong>Antenna or Space diversity</strong>.</p> <h3>Frequency Diversity</h3> <p>The same information signal is transmitted on different carriers, the frequency separation between them being at least the coherence bandwidth.</p> <h3>Time Diversity</h3> <p>The information signal is transmitted repeatedly in time at regularly intervals. The separation between the&nbsp;<strong>transmit times should be greater than the coherence time, T<sub>c</sub></strong>. The time interval depends on the fading rate, and increases with the decrease in the rate of fading.</p> <h3>Polarization diversity</h3> <p>Here, the electric and magnetic fields of the signal carrying the information are modified and many such signals are used to send the same information. Thus&nbsp;<strong>orthogonal type of polarization is obtained</strong>.</p> <h3>Angle Diversity</h3> <p>Here, directional antennas are used to create independent copies of the transmitted signal over multiple paths.</p> <h3>Space Diversity</h3> <p>In Space diversity, there are multiple receiving antennas placed at different spatial locations, resulting in different (possibly independent) received signals.</p> <p>The difference between the diversity schemes lies in the fact that in the first two schemes, there is&nbsp;<strong>wastage of bandwidth</strong>&nbsp;due to&nbsp;<strong>duplication of the information</strong>&nbsp;signal to be sent. Thus problem is avoided in the remaining three schemes, but with the cost of increased&nbsp;<strong>antenna complexity</strong>.</p> <p>The correlation between signals as a function of distance between the antenna elements is given by the relation &minus;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3 class=\"MathJax_Display\"><span id=\"MathJax-Element-1-Frame\" class=\"MathJax\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; display: inline; line-height: normal; word-spacing: normal; overflow-wrap: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; border: 0px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; position: relative;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-mathml=\"&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;&lt;mi&gt;&amp;#x03C1;&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msubsup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;J&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msubsup&gt;&lt;mo fence=&quot;false&quot; stretchy=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&amp;#x27EE;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mfrac&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;&amp;#x03A0;&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;&amp;#x03BB;&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mfrac&gt;&lt;mo fence=&quot;false&quot; stretchy=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&amp;#x27EF;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/math&gt;\"><span class=\"MJX_Assistive_MathML MJX_Assistive_MathML_Block\">&rho;=J02⟮2&Pi;d/&lambda;⟯</span></span></h3> <p>or</p> <h3 class=\"MathJax_Display\">Pr=PtGtGr(&lambda;4&Pi;d)2</h3> <h3 class=\"MathJax_Display\">Pr=PtGtGr(&lambda;4&Pi;d)2</h3> <p>Where,</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li> <p><strong>J<sub>0</sub></strong>&nbsp;= Bessel function of zero order and first kind</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>d</strong>&nbsp;= distance of separation in space of antenna elements</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>&lambda;</strong>&nbsp;= carrier wavelength.</p> </li> </ul>"

Point to point configuration with one master and one slave is the simplest configuration.</p> <p>When more than two Bluetooth devices communicate with one another, this is called a&nbsp;<strong>PICONET</strong>. A Piconet can contain up to seven slaves clustered around a single master.

            "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Wireless Communication - Internet</h1> <p>The advent of the Internet has caused a revolutionary change in the use of computers and the search for information. The Internet has affected the traditional way of information exchange and now almost every city, every town, and every street has access to the Internet.</p> <p>Homes, schools and businesses connect to the Internet today using a variety of different methods. One method, wireless Internet service, provides Internet access to customers without the need for underground copper, fiber, or other forms of commercial network cabling. Compared to more established wired services like DSL and cable Internet, wireless technology brings added convenience and mobility to computer networks.</p> <p>The below sections describe each popular type of wireless Internet service available.</p> <h2>Satellite Internet</h2> <p>Introduced in the mid1990s, satellite became the first mainstream consumer wireless Internet service. Compared to other forms of wireless Internet service, satellite enjoys the advantage of&nbsp;<strong>availability</strong>. Requiring only a small&nbsp;<strong>dish antenna, satellite modem</strong>&nbsp;and subscription plan, satellite works in almost all rural areas not serviced by other technologies.</p> <p>However, satellite also offers relatively low performing wireless Internet. Satellite suffers from&nbsp;<strong>high latency</strong>&nbsp;(delay) connections due to the long distance signals must travel between Earth and the orbiting stations. Satellite also supports relatively modest amounts of network bandwidth.</p> <h3>Public Wi-Fi Networks</h3> <p>Some municipalities have built their public wireless Internet service using&nbsp;<strong>Wi-Fi</strong>&nbsp;technology. These so-called&nbsp;<strong>mesh networks</strong>&nbsp;join numerous wireless access points together to span larger urban areas. Individual Wi-Fi hotspots also provide public wireless Internet service in select locations.</p> <p>Wi-Fi is a low-cost option relative to other forms of wireless Internet service. Equipment is inexpensive (many newer computers have the needed hardware built in), and Wi-Fi hotspots remains free in some locales.</p> <h3>Fixed Wireless Broadband</h3> <p>Fixed wireless is a type of broadband that utilizes mounted antennas pointed at radio transmission towers.</p> <h3>Mobile Broadband</h3> <p>Cell phones have existed for decades, but only recently have cellular networks evolved to become a mainstream form of wireless Internet service. With an installed cellular network adapter, or by tethering a cell phone to a laptop computer,&nbsp;<strong>Internet connectivity</strong>&nbsp;can be maintained in any area with cell tower coverage. Mobile broadband service will not function without having an Internet data subscription in place from some provider.</p> <p>The classical wired networks have given rise to a number of application protocols such as TELNET, FTP and SMTP. The wireless application protocol (WAP) architecture aims at bridging the gap at the application level, between the wireless users and the services offered to them.</p> <h2>Wireless Internet</h2> <p>Wireless Internet refers to the extension of the services offered by the Internet to mobile users, enabling them to&nbsp;<strong>access information</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>data</strong>irrespective of their location. The inherent problems associated with wireless domain, mobility of nodes, and the design of existing protocols used in the Internet, require several solutions for making the wireless Internet a reality.</p> <p>The major issues that are to be considered for Wireless Internet are the following &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Address mobility</li> <li>Inefficiency of transport layer protocols and</li> <li>Inefficiency of application layer protocols</li> </ul> <h3>Address Mobility</h3> <p>The network layer protocol used in the Internet is Internet Protocol (IP) which was designed for wired networks with fixed nodes. IP employs a hierarchical addressing with a globally unique 32-bit address which has two parts&nbsp;<strong>Network identifier</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Host identifier</strong>.</p> <p>The network identifier refers to the&nbsp;<strong>subnet address</strong>&nbsp;to which the host is connected. The addressing scheme was used to reduce the routing table size in the core routers of the Internet, which uses only the network part of the IP address for making routing decisions.</p> <p>This addressing scheme may not work directly in the wireless extension of the Internet, as the mobile hosts may move from one&nbsp;<strong>subnet</strong>&nbsp;to another, but the packets addressed to the mobile host may be delivered to the old subnet to which the node was originally attached.</p> <h3>Inefficiency of Transport Layer Protocols</h3> <p>The transport layer is very important in the Internet and it ensures setting up and maintaining&nbsp;<strong>end-to-end connections</strong>, reliable&nbsp;<strong>end-to-end delivery</strong>&nbsp;of data packets,&nbsp;<strong>flow control</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>congestion control</strong>. TCP is the predominant transport layer protocol for wired networks, even though&nbsp;<strong>UDP</strong>, a connectionless unreliable transport layer protocol is used by certain applications.</p> <p>Wireless Internet requires efficient operation of the transport layer protocols as the wireless medium is inherently unreliable due to its time varying and environment dependent characteristics. Traditional TCP invokes a&nbsp;<strong>congestion control algorithm</strong>&nbsp;in order to handle congestion in the networks. If a data packet or an ACK packet is lost, then TCP assumes that the&nbsp;<strong>loss is due to congestion</strong>&nbsp;and reduces the size of the congestion window by half.</p> <p>With every successive packet loss, the&nbsp;<strong>congestion window is reduced</strong>, and hence TCP provides a degraded performance in wireless links. Even in situations where the packet loss is caused by&nbsp;<strong>link error</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>collision</strong>, the TCP invokes the congestion control algorithm leading to very low throughput.</p> <p>The identification of the real cause that led to the packet loss is important in improving the performance of the TCP over wireless links. Some of the solutions for the transport layer issues include &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Indirect TCP (ITCP)</li> <li>Snoop TCP and</li> <li>Mobile TCP</li> </ul> <h3>Inefficiency of Application Layer Protocols</h3> <p>Traditional application layer protocols used in the Internet such as&nbsp;<strong>HTTP, TELNET,</strong>&nbsp;simple mail transfer protocol (<strong>SMTP</strong>), and several markup languages such as&nbsp;<strong>HTML</strong>&nbsp;were designed and optimized for wired networks. Many of these protocols are not very efficient when used with wireless links.</p> <p>The major issues that prevent HTTP from being used in Wireless Internet are its stateless operation, high overhead due to character encoding, redundant information carried in the HTTP requests, and opening of a&nbsp;<strong>new TCP connection</strong>&nbsp;with every transaction.</p> <p>The capabilities of the handheld devices are limited, making it difficult to handle computationally and bandwidth wise expensive application protocols. Wireless application protocol (<strong>WAP</strong>) and optimizations over traditional HTTP are some of the solutions for the application layer issues.</p>"

            "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Wireless Communication - Satellite</h1> <p>A satellite is an object that revolves around another object. For example, earth is a satellite of The Sun, and moon is a satellite of earth.</p> <p>A&nbsp;<strong>communication satellite</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<strong>microwave repeater station</strong>&nbsp;in a space that is used for telecommunication, radio and television signals. A communication satellite processes the data coming from one earth station and it converts the data into another form and send it to the second earth station.</p> <h2>How a Satellite Works</h2> <p>Two stations on earth want to communicate through radio broadcast but are too far away to use conventional means. The two stations can use a relay station for their communication. One earth station transmits the signal to the satellite.</p> <p><strong>Uplink frequency</strong>&nbsp;is the frequency at which ground station is communicating with satellite. The satellite transponder converts the signal and sends it down to the second earth station, and this is called&nbsp;<strong>Downlink frequency</strong>. The second earth station also communicates with the first one in the same way.</p> <h3>Advantages of Satellite</h3> <p>The advantages of Satellite Communications are as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>The Coverage area is very high than that of terrestrial systems.</li> <li>The transmission cost is independent of the coverage area.</li> <li>Higher bandwidths are possible.</li> </ul> <h3>Disadvantages of Satellite</h3> <p>The disadvantages of Satellite Communications are as follows &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Launching satellites into orbits is a costly process.</li> <li>The bandwidths are gradually used up.</li> <li>High propagation delay for satellite systems than the conventional terrestrial systems.</li> </ul> <h2>Satellite Communication Basics</h2> <p>The process of satellite communication begins at an&nbsp;<strong>earth station</strong>. Here an installation is designed to transmit and receive signals from a satellite in orbit around the earth. Earth stations send information to satellites in the form of high powered, high frequency (GHz range) signals.</p> <p>The satellites&nbsp;<strong>receive</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>retransmit</strong>&nbsp;the signals back to earth where they are received by other earth stations in the coverage area of the satellite.&nbsp;<strong>Satellite's footprint</strong>&nbsp;is the area which receives a signal of useful strength from the satellite.</p> <p>The transmission system from the earth station to the satellite through a channel is called the&nbsp;<strong>uplink</strong>. The system from the satellite to the earth station through the channel is called the&nbsp;<strong>downlink</strong>.</p> <h3>Satellite Frequency Bands</h3> <p>The satellite frequency bands which are commonly used for communication are the&nbsp;<strong>Cband, Ku-band,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Ka-band</strong>. C-band and Ku-band are the commonly used frequency spectrums by today's satellites.</p> <p>It is important to note that there is an inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength i.e. when frequency increases, wavelength decreases this helps to understand the relationship between&nbsp;<strong>antenna diameter</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>transmission frequency</strong>. Larger antennas (satellite dishes) are necessary to gather the signal with increasing wavelength.</p> <h2>Earth Orbits</h2> <p>A satellite when launched into space, needs to be placed in certain orbit to provide a particular way for its revolution, so as to maintain accessibility and serve its purpose whether scientific, military or commercial. Such orbits which are assigned to satellites, with respect to earth are called as&nbsp;<strong>Earth Orbits</strong>. The satellites in these orbits are Earth Orbit Satellites.</p> <p>The important kinds of Earth Orbits are &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Geo-synchronous Earth Orbit</li> <li>Geo-stationary Earth Orbit</li> <li>Medium Earth Orbit</li> <li>Low Earth Orbit</li> </ul> <h3>Geo-synchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) Satellites</h3> <p>A Geo-synchronous Earth orbit Satellite is one which is placed at an altitude of 22,300 miles above the Earth. This orbit is synchronized with a&nbsp;<strong>side real day</strong>(i.e., 23hours 56minutes). This orbit can&nbsp;<strong>have inclination and eccentricity</strong>. It may not be circular. This orbit can be tilted at the poles of the earth. But it appears stationary when observed from the Earth.</p> <p>The same geo-synchronous orbit, if it is&nbsp;<strong>circular</strong>&nbsp;and in the plane of equator, it is called as geo-stationary orbit. These Satellites are placed at 35,900kms (same as geosynchronous) above the Earth&rsquo;s Equator and they keep on rotating with respect to earth&rsquo;s direction (west to east). These satellites are considered&nbsp;<strong>stationary</strong>&nbsp;with respect to earth and hence the name implies.</p> <p>Geo-Stationary Earth Orbit Satellites are used for weather forecasting, satellite TV, satellite radio and other types of global communications.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/wireless_communication/images/geo.jpg\" alt=\"GEO\" /></p> <p>The above figure shows the difference between Geo-synchronous and Geo- Stationary orbits. The Axis of rotation indicates the movement of Earth.</p> <p>The main point to note here is that every Geo-Stationary orbit is a Geo-Synchronous orbit. But every Geo-Synchronous orbit is NOT a Geo-stationary orbit.</p> <h3>Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) Satellites</h3> <p>Medium earth orbit (MEO) satellite networks will orbit at distances of about 8000 miles from earth's surface. Signals transmitted from a MEO satellite travel a shorter distance. This translates to improved signal strength at the receiving end. This shows that smaller, more lightweight receiving terminals can be used at the receiving end.</p> <p>Since the signal is travelling a shorter distance to and from the satellite, there is less transmission delay.&nbsp;<strong>Transmission delay</strong>&nbsp;can be defined as the time it takes for a signal to travel up to a satellite and back down to a receiving station.</p> <p>For real-time communications, the shorter the transmission delay, the better will be the communication system. As an example, if a GEO satellite requires 0.25 seconds for a round trip, then MEO satellite requires less than 0.1 seconds to complete the same trip. MEOs operates in the frequency range of 2 GHz and above.</p> <h3>Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites</h3> <p>The LEO satellites are mainly classified into three categories namely, little LEOs, big LEOs, and Mega-LEOs. LEOs will orbit at a distance of 500 to 1000 miles above the earth's surface.</p> <p>This relatively short distance reduces transmission delay to only 0.05 seconds. This further reduces the need for sensitive and bulky receiving equipment. Little LEOs will operate in the 800 MHz (0.8 GHz) range. Big LEOs will operate in the 2 GHz or above range, and Mega-LEOs operates in the 20-30 GHz range.</p> <p>The higher frequencies associated with&nbsp;<strong>Mega-LEOs</strong>&nbsp;translates into more information carrying capacity and yields to the capability of real-time, low delay video transmission scheme.</p> <h3>High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) Platforms</h3> <p>Experimental HALE platforms are basically highly efficient and lightweight airplanes carrying communications equipment. This will act as&nbsp;<strong>very low earth orbit geosynchronous satellites</strong>.</p> <p>These crafts will be powered by a combination of battery and solar power or high efficiency turbine engines. HALE platforms will offer&nbsp;<strong>transmission delays of less than 0.001 seconds</strong>&nbsp;at an altitude of only 70,000 feet, and even&nbsp;<strong>better signal strength</strong>&nbsp;for very lightweight hand-held receiving devices.</p> <h3>Orbital Slots</h3> <p>Here there may arise a question that with more than&nbsp;<strong>200 satellites</strong>&nbsp;up there in geosynchronous orbit, how do we keep them from running into each other or from attempting to use the same location in space? To answer this problem, international regulatory bodies like the International Telecommunications Union (<strong>ITU</strong>) and national government organizations like the Federal Communications Commission (<strong>FCC</strong>) designate the locations on the geosynchronous orbit where the communications satellites can be located.</p> <p>These locations are specified in degrees of longitude and are called as&nbsp;<strong>orbital slots</strong>. The FCC and ITU have progressively reduced the required spacing down to only 2 degrees for C-band and Ku-band satellites due to the huge demand for orbital slots.</p>"
